Apart from using a <strong>Pokémon Go 100 IV map</strong>, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg"                      alt="catch 100 iv pokemon"                ></p><ul><li>If you are fortunate, then you can end up <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >catching a “lucky” Pokémon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg"                      alt="trading increases the chance of perfect ivs"                ></p><ul><li>For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375</li><li>With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744</li><li>When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197</li><li>Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331</li></ul><p>But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application.

Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites.

Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”</strong></em></p><p>If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu"><a href="#Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu"></a>Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu</h2><h3 id="What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?"></a>What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?</h3><p>Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible.

Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.</p><p>With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool</strong></p><p>To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Teleport to any other location</strong></p><p>After when your device is detected, Dr.Fone will automatically display its exact location on the screen.

When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.</p><p>What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?</p><p>The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="An image of a Pokémon Master Ball"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-get-unlimited-master-balls-in-Pokemon-Emerald"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-get-unlimited-master-balls-in-Pokemon-Emerald" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?"></a>Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?</h2><p>There are ways in which you can get unlimited Pokémon Master Balls using the Pokémon emerald Master Ball cheat codes available today.</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Save your game</p><p>When you are using Pokémon game emulators such as the GameShark, you can take a snapshot of the game and save it.

All you have to do is go up to the register and then buy a Pokéball, and you will get a Master Ball instead, without having to pay a dime.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg"                      alt="Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls"                ></p><p>Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want.

This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature</strong></p><p>At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p>Great!

Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg"                      alt="fake gps lexa"                ></p><p>Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg"                      alt="select mock location app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Change your device’s location</strong></p><p>That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg"                      alt="fake location on lexa"                ></p><p>There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your iPhone location.

Defeating a Team Go Rocket Leader and Go Battle Reward is Sinnoh Stone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/sinnoh-stones-to-level-up.jpg"                      alt="sinnoh stones to level up"                ></p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to mock your location without any movement and obtain these Sinnoh Stones. Dr.Fone’s virtual location allows you to mock your location and lets the application on your phone think that you’re at a place selected in Dr.Fone’s application interface without resulting in any ban or detection from Pokemon Go developers. You can follow the steps listed below in order to catch Pokemon by one click to go anywhere without moving.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Mocking Location Quirk:</strong></p><p>Pokemon Go can be played by using the toolkit of Dr. Fone without shifting. Open the Virtual Location feature using a functioning lightning cable to mock the location and ensure that the iOS device is linked to the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>You can press the Get Started” button to start the process upon phone detection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Imitating Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>Open the first choice located in the top-right corner until you enter Dr.Fone’s GUI, which helps you to fake movement between the two locations. Select the location pin found in the search bar and press the “Move Here” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p>You want to make a motion, and navigate to the “March” button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone’s virtual location application.</p><p>Click the ‘March’ button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You’ll have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Requirement-and-Evolving-Pokemon’s-Using-Sinnoh-Stone"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Requirement-and-Evolving-Pokemon’s-Using-Sinnoh-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon’s Using Sinnoh Stone"></a>Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon’s Using Sinnoh Stone</h2><p>Only the trainers above the 10th Level have access to acquire Sinnoh Stone. The Sinnoh Stone can be obtained from Training Battles and Training with Team Leaders. You also need 100 candies for each of the Pokemon. Once you have got your hands on Sinnoh Stones and now you want to know where they should be used, there’s numerous 4th generation Pokémon who require Sinnoh Stone for their upgrade. Mamoswine is one of the best if you’re prioritizing attackers for a raid because it has a mix of extremely high CP with the strong ground and ice-type moves.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sinnoh Stone, a rare evolution item, is one of the Perks of Pokemon Go letting you evolve your favorite Pokemon and keep them throughout your journey in the game. Dr.Fone’s virtual application lets you find them with ease without any real movement on your part and helps you enjoy the game to the fullest.</p><h2 id="Planning-to-Use-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E"><a href="#Planning-to-Use-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E" class="headerlink" title="Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Xiaomi Redmi K70E?"></a>Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Xiaomi Redmi K70E?</h2><p>Pokemon Go is probably one of the most popular location-based augmented reality games that encourage us to step out. Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know"><a href="#Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know"></a><strong>Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.</p><ul><li>Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.</li><li>They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.</li><li>The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick"                ></p><p>Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?"></a><strong>Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?</strong></h2><p>There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS&#x2F;Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your iPhone to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.</p><ul><li>Users can instantly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like by entering the exact coordinates or its address.</li><li>It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your iPhone.</li><li>If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.</li><li>The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.</li><li>There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import&#x2F;export routes as GPX files.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope that after following this guide, you would be able to know more about the fake GPS Pokemon Go hacks. As you can see, I have included all kinds of benefits and limitations of using a Pokemon Go joystick in this guide. If you don’t want to get your account banned for using a Pokemon joystick, then consider going with a reliable option like</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.</p><p>What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?"></a>Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?</h2><p>A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you’re soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.</p><p>What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?"></a>Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?</h2><p>When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?</h2><h3 id="1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down"><a href="#1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down" class="headerlink" title="1. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?"></a>1. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?</h3><p>The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Total Distance Covered</strong></th><th><strong>Cooldown Period</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 km</td><td>30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>5 km</td><td>2 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>10 km</td><td>6 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>25 km</td><td>11 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>30 km</td><td>14 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>65 km</td><td>22 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>81 km</td><td>25 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>100 km</td><td>35 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>250 km</td><td>45 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>500 km</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>750 km</td><td>1 hour 20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>1000 km</td><td>1 hour 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;1500 km</td><td>2 hour</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="2-How-long-must-I-wait-to-avoid-a-softban"><a href="#2-How-long-must-I-wait-to-avoid-a-softban" class="headerlink" title="2. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?"></a>2. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?</h3><p>The waiting period for a soft ban is around 12 hours. After this time, if you can try and catch a Pokémon, it means the soft ban is over.</p><h3 id="3-Actions-that-Do-trigger-cooldown"><a href="#3-Actions-that-Do-trigger-cooldown" class="headerlink" title="3. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?"></a>3. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?</h3><p>The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.</p><p>So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.</p><ul><li>If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan’s Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.</li><li>Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.</li><li>When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.</li><li>When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.</li><li>Gym battles.</li><li>When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Actions-that-DO-NOT-trigger-cooldown"><a href="#4-Actions-that-DO-NOT-trigger-cooldown" class="headerlink" title="4.

Follow these steps.</p><ol><li>First, open the Google Maps menu and select ‘Your places’.</li><li>Select ‘Maps’ &gt; ‘Create map’.</li><li>Select the ‘Import’ button after a new Google Maps window opens.</li><li>Finally, upload your gpx file.

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues"><a href="#Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Start from the low leagues"></a>Tip 1: Start from the low leagues</h3><p>As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves"><a href="#Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves"></a>Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves</h3><p>Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle.

Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><p>Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works.

If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons.

The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?"></a>Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?</h2><p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><p>Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15&#x2F;15&#x2F;15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.</p><ul><li>A Pokémon with 45&#x2F;45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.</li><li>These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.</li></ul><p>Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map.

Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Xiaomi Mix Fold 3? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon home vs pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players’ interest completely.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Xiaomi Redmi 13C and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg"                      alt="change your location to a few meters away"                ></p></li></ol><p>Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs. The regular use of an app like this might result in your account ban.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Fix-Your-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-on-a-Drone-and-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-3-Fix-Your-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-on-a-Drone-and-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 3: Fix Your Xiaomi Redmi 13C on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 3: Fix Your Xiaomi Redmi 13C on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>Apart from a location spoofing app, there are a handful of other ways to learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go. Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Xiaomi Redmi 13C service on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg"                      alt="go to your profile"                ></p></li><li><p>Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.</p></li><li><p>That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg"                      alt="help friends hack eggs"                ></p></li></ol><p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong></p><p>If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!</p><h2 id="Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators"><a href="#Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators" class="headerlink" title="Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators"></a>Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators</h2><p>You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg"                      alt="get Pokecoins"                ></p></li><li><p>Great! Once you have enough Pokecoins, go to the Shop again and choose to buy eggs and incubators.</p></li><li><p>After getting enough incubators, you can go to your collection and apply more incubators to hatch eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-9.jpg"                      alt="apply more incubators"                ></p></li></ol><h2 id="Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard"><a href="#Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard" class="headerlink" title="Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard"></a>Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard</h2><p>This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong>. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you’re walking and hatch the eggs. Because the turntable creates enough motion in a wide enough circle that it will trick your phone’s internal sensors into thinking you’re walking. This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking.jpg"                      alt="play pokemon go with turntable"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Tired of walking to hatch eggs?
