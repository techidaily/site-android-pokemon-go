## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Motorola Moto G34 5G?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‘vigilante’ does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.

## How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Motorola Moto G34 5G

The steady increase in the number of Pokemon Go users has simultaneously led to the expansion of the software. And such is the use of **Pokemon Go promo codes** and Pokemon promo cards. Pokemon Go promo codes are short-time alphanumeric codes that allow you to receive free in-game items, as Pokemon prize cards are awards that are gifted to the players who can intensely beat the Pokemon and knock it out.

Pokemon promo codes or promo cards elevate your game to a whole new level since you will be able to possess the Poke balls, berries, lucky eggs, incense, and other various loots. They will make your game an absolute breeze, and you necessarily won’t move around as you play. Besides, Pokemon promo codes are short-lasting; you, therefore, need to claim them quickly.

This article gives an insight on how to get and use Pokemon Go promo codes and promo cards.

## Part 1: How to Get Pokemon Go Promo Codes

Pokemon Go often offers promo codes on special events or after successful partnerships.

The availability of Pokemon promo codes is not constant – They do come and go.

Pokemon promo codes are unpredictable, and so are their rewards. Some promo codes will offer exceptional gifts such as cosmetics, while others may be in-game supplies such as Pokeballs and berries.

Niantic shares some free Pokemon Go promo codes on their official Twitter account. Their official statement on the website says, "Niantic offers a limited supply of one-time use codes in conjunction with special events or sponsored partnerships."

Pokemon Go also has daily free boxes, the ones you attain at no additional cost.

To check if you have received your daily free boxes, you need to glimpse at your store on a day-to-day basis.

With your free boxes, you can obtain different items.

## How to use iSpoofer on Motorola Moto G34 5G?

iSpoofer is a location spoofer that allows you to change your location on your device. This is useful for games like Pokemon Go, where you can catch Pokemons from different regions without leaving your home. However, iSpoofer is not available for download anymore. If you are looking for an alternative to iSpoofer, you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to spoof your location on your Motorola Moto G34 5G.

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that’s designed to simulate a user's GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download **iSpoofer for Android** or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.

So, without any further ado, let’s get started.

- [Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1)
- [Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2)

## ****Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****

Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download **iSpoofer for Android** at all.

However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.

## ****Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android****

When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. _Why?_ Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.

Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.

1. **Use VMOS**

VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.

![vmos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg)

The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.

2. **Root Your Device**

Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.

3. **Use PGSharp**

PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to **iSpoofer for Android**. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.

**Note:** Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official [<u>PGSharp website</u>](https://www.pgsharp.com/).

## **Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location**

So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.

It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone/iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Motorola Moto G34 5Gs.

It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, [<u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

- Change your current location with a single click
- Use GPS coordinates to find locations
- Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature
- Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions
- Compatible with all iOS versions

Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).
