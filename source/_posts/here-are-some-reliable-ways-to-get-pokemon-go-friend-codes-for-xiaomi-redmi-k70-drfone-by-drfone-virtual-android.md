## How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Xiaomi Redmi K70?

Pokémon Go is a location-based AR game and is very popular in the world of gaming. Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg)

For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.

But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.

### 2\. Use VPN

You can leverage VPN to change your location and fool Pokémon to complete the research breakthrough. However, you should be cautious with the VPN provider. The good thing about VPN is that they are secure and do not require jailbreaking. The downside is that good VPNs are expensive and are restricted to server locations.

### 3\. iSpoofer

This is a desktop-based spoofing tool which can help you fake your location. It does not require jailbreaking and thus can easily spoof for Pokémon Go. The downside is that it requires Windows PC and that the premium version is expensive.
