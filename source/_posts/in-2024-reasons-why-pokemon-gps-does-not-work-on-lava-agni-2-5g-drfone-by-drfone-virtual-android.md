## Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?

To understand the dynamics of team composition, you should know that there are ideally different kinds of Pokemons:

- Sweeper: These Pokemons are mostly used to attack as they can do a lot of damage and even move swiftly. Though, they have low defense stats and can be of a physical or special type.
- Tanker: These Pokemons have high defense stats and can take a lot of damage. Though, they have slow movement and low attacking stats.
- Annoyer: They are known for their fast movement and while their damage might not be so high, they can annoy your opponents.
- Cleric: These are supportive Pokemons that are mostly used to heal or boost the stats of other Pokemons.
- Drainer: These are also supportive Pokemons, but they can drain the stats of your opponents while healing your team.
- Wall: These are tougher than tank Pokemons and can take a substantial amount of damage from sweepers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![hola free vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg)

Based on these different types of Pokemons, you can come up with the following teams to win your next battle:

### 1\. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer

If you want to have an attacking team, then this would be the perfect combination. While the annoyer and tanker would drain the HP of the opponents, your sweeper Pokemons can finish them with their high attacking stats.

### 2\. 3x Sweepers (Physical/Special/Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer

This is one of the most balanced Pokemon teams that would work in almost every situation. In this, we have a tanker and a wall to take damage from the opponent’s Pokemon. Also, we have three different types of sweepers to do maximum damage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Drainer, Tanker, Cleric, and 3 Sweepers (Physical/Special/Mixed)

In some situations (when there are lots of sweepers in the opponent’s team), this team would excel. Your support Pokemons (drainers and clerics) would boost the HP of sweepers while the tanker would take the damage.

### 4\. Rayquaza, Arceus, Dialga, Kyogre, Palkia, and Groudon

This is one of the most legendary teams in Pokemon that any player can have. The only issue is catching these legendary Pokemons can take a lot of time and effort, but it would certainly be worth it.

### 5\. Garchomp, Decidueye, Salazzle, Araquanid, Metagross, and Weavile

Even if you don’t have a lot of experience in the game, you can try this power-packed team in Pokemon games like Sun and Moon. It has the perfect balance of attacking and defensive Pokemons that would excel in every situation.

## Part 2: Things to Consider while Creating your Pokemon Team

Since there could be so many ways for coming up with a Pokemon team, I would recommend following these suggestions:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 1: Consider your strategy

The most important thing that you need to know is the overall strategy that you have to focus on game. For instance, at times, players would like to play defensively while others want to focus on attacking. Therefore, you can come up with a team composition according to your needs.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 2: Try to attain a balanced team

Needless to say, if you have all attacking or all defensive Pokemons in your team, then you might not get the desired results. That’s why it is recommended to have a mixed bag of sweepers, healers, tankers, annoyers, etc. in your team.

### Tip 3: Don’t pick Pokemons with common weaknesses

It is always recommended to have a diverse team so that your opponent can’t harass you. For instance, if two or more Pokemons have the same type of weakness, then your opponent can easily win by counter-picking Pokemons.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 4: Practice and alter your team

Even if you have a decent team, it doesn’t mean that it would excel in all scenarios. It is always recommended to keep practicing with your team every now and team. Also, feel free to edit your team by swapping Pokemons. We have discussed how to edit Pokemon teams in the next section.

### Fix 5: Research and pick rare Pokemons

Most importantly, keep looking up for Pokemon team suggestions by experts online and via other Pokemon-related communities. Also, a lot of players suggest picking rare or legendary Pokemons as they have limited weaknesses, making them harder to be countered.

## Part 4: How to Cheat at Pokemon Go

The Pokemon Go promo code is not usually available at all times. However, this should not limit your play. You don’t necessarily have to move around for you to catch the Pokemon. You can still enjoy playing Pokemon Go in your comfort. You, therefore, have to involve a third-party tool. And the best software tool to use is Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool is an award-winning professional tool that allows you to teleport effortlessly. The key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location are:

- It has instant teleportation. It helps in concealing your GPS location
- It has a full-screen HD map view
- It has a joystick tool that comfortably allows you to spoof your location
- It will enable you to spoof your GRS location with a single click



Faking GPS location in iPhone devices differs from Android devices.

**iPhone devices --**

Here are the simple steps of using Dr. Fone - Virtual Location in faking your location on Pokemon Go on the iPhone.

**Step 1. Launch Dr. Fone Virtual Location to your computer.**

![install dr. fone to start faking gps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![search for a location to fake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Here, you need to search for a suitable location that you would like to teleport to. Hit the **‘teleport**’ option from the toolbar at the top-right corner of the interface.

**Step 4. Teleport to your desired location**

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Various options of places you would like to teleport to will be there on display. You can search for it using the search bar or select one from the displayed list and hit the **‘Go’** icon.

**Step 5. Teleport to your chosen location**

For you to teleport to your chosen location, you need to drop a pin on your preferred place and hit the **‘Move Here’** icon. Now, you will be able to catch more Pokemon since you have already altered your location.

**Android Phones --**

Faking location on Android phones is undoubtedly more straightforward than on iPhones. In Android phones, hacking the GPS location does not necessarily involve using a computer device.

Here are the simple steps of how to fake your GPS location on Android devices.

**Step 1.  Enable the developer options**

<a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png" border="0"> PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a>

![enable option to let developer mode be turned on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-11.jpg)

When you want to fake your location to allow you to play Pokemon Go freely, the first thing to do is unlock your developer options settings.

Go to the **‘Setting’** menu, which is usually at the top right corner of your interface. Scroll down and click on the **‘About Phone.’** Search for the **‘Build number’** option and click on it. Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification **‘You are now a developer’** appears.

**Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your Lava Agni 2 5G**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![wa stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-12.jpg)

To get the Mock Location option, you go back to the **‘Settings’** menu. Scroll down search for **‘Allow Mock Locations’** and turn it on when you find it. Allow mocking of the Fake GPS app.

**Step 4. Search for your desired location to fake**

Go to your Fake GPS application and search for a preferred location. To initiate the process, hit the **‘Search’** bar.

**Step 5. Confirm your new location**

![search and confirm your new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokemon-go-fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

Lastly, head back to your Pokemon Go app. There, you can see your new location cast.

### Conclusion

All **Pokemon promo codes** have an expiry time frame. And the time frames are usually shorter. Therefore, you need to use them before their due time elapses. Currently, there are no Pokemon promo codes. And for you to continue playing Pokemon Go, you need to involve a third-party tool, and the best tool to use is Dr. Fone Virtual Location.
