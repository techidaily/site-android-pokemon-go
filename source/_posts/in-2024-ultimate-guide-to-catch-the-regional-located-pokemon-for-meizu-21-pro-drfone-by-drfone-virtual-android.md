## Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Meizu 21 Pro

![complete your pokedex with regional pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-1.jpg)

Since its release in 2016, Pokemon GO, Niantic’s viral augmented reality mobile game, has slowly but surely been adding regional Pokemon, exclusive creatures living in specific areas around the globe.

While keeping track of where each regional Pokemon spawns can be pretty confusing, catching these Pokemon poses another challenge. Completing your Pokedex requires a lot of traveling to specific parts of the globe, trading with players who have been there, or waiting for Pokemon GO’s special events.

Alternatively, players can use virtual location-changing tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone, and today, we’ll show you how to catch all **Pokemon GO regional exclusives** with this easy-to-use app.

## Part 1. What Are Regional Pokemon?

Regional Pokemon are exclusive creatures in Niantic’s Pokemon GO AR game that only live in specific regions across the globe. The area in which a particular Pokemon can be found depends on the nature of that Pokemon. For example, Tropius can only be found in tropical parts of the continent.

## Part 2. How Regional Pokemon in Pokemon GO Work

Catching all Pokemon GO regional exclusive creatures and completing your Pokedex is a great challenge. There are multiple ways you can go about it, including some of the following strategies:

- Traveling to specific parts of the world;
- Using Wondershare Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location Changer;
- Waiting for special events that lift distribution restrictions;
- Trading Pokemon with other players from across the globe.

Avid Pokemon trainers can use one or a combination of these strategies to swiftly fill up their Pokedex with complete data about all Pokemon in the wild.

## Part 3. Continents of Regional Pokemon

![regional spawn points in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-2.jpg)

The spawn points of regional Pokemon vary significantly between creatures. Some are exclusive to a hemisphere, others to a continent, while the third group only spawns in a few specific countries. Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that’s why we’ve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.

| **Region** | **Pokemon** |
| --- | --- |
| _Africa_ | Corsola, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Pansear, Throh, Basculin, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Red Flabebe, Furfrou Trim, Oricorio, Kartana, Celesteela |
| _Asia_ | Farfetch’d, Corsola, Volbeat, Torkoal, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pachirisu, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Fabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana Celesteela |
| _Australia_ | Kangaskhan, Corsola, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Celesteela |
| _Europe_ | Mr. Mime, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Mime Jr., Pansear, Sawk, Basculin, Sigilyph, Heatmor, Vivillon, Klefki, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _Middle East_ | Corsola, Tropius, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansear, Basculin, Sawk, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _New Zealand_ | Chatot, Relicanth, Shellos, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmore, Vivillon, Celesteela |
| _North America_ | Tauros, Heracross, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Pachirisu, Shellos, Carnivine, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Bouffalant, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Hawlucha, Oricorio, Comfey, Kartana |
| _South America_ | Heracross, Corsola, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Shellos, Chatot, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Celesteela |

While they’re categorized as available on the entire continent, it’s worth noting that some Pokemon can only be found in particular regions like France or Russia. To learn more about each, you’ll need to find information about their regional distribution.

## Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution

With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.

### Getting Information From the Community

The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.

### Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements

Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.

## Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions

While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.

However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.

Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Here’s how:

1. Download the app from [<u>the official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/)and install it on your computer.



3. Click **Toolbox**in the upper left part of the screen and select **Virtual Location**.

![wondershare dr.fone’s home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

5. Connect your iPhone or Android to the computer via USB or Wi-Fi.
6. Select the **Teleport Mode**in the top right part.

![use dr.fone’s teleport mode feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

8. Type in a location and press **Enter**.

![select a new virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

10. Change your virtual location by clicking the **Move Here**

![move to the selected virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

12. The app’s location will now change on PC.

![verify location change on the computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

14. You should also check your mobile device’s location to confirm it’s changed.

![confirm location change on the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

Wondershare Dr.Fone also includes a Jump Teleport Mode, allowing you to swiftly swap virtual locations and simulate movement along a predestined route. This feature can be remarkably beneficial for Pokemon GO players, and here’s how you can use it:

1. Click the **Jump Teleport Mode**button (the second button in the row).

![select dr.fone’s jump teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/jump-teleport-mode.png)

3. Type in and add multiple virtual locations, and click the **Start Moving**

![move between multiple virtual locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/choose-jump-teleport-destination.png)

5. Switch your virtual location by clicking **Next Point**and **Last Point** to move forward or backward.

![move along the created route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/start-use-jump-teleport-mode.png)

Movement simulation works exceptionally well for catching Pokemon around the globe, and you’ll be able to encounter dozens of these. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone to progress swiftly through the game and catch them all!

## Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events

While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.

The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.

It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.

## Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon

As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.

However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.

## Conclusion

Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.

Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.

The first appearance of this pokemon was via Pokemon Go, as a mysterious silhouette. There are a huge hue and cry among the pokemon lovers about this mystery box pokemon.

![meltan mystery box](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meltan-mystery-box.jpg)

## Part 1: What is the meltan box and how does it work?

Meltan, the mythical Pokemon is also described as a Hex Nut Pokemon. A major part of its body is built from liquid metal and its shape is fluid. It generates electricity using the metal that it absorbs from the outside sources. The pokemon uses its arms and legs to corrode metal and absorb it into its own body.

![meltan pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meltan-pokemon.jpg)

The meltan box is actually a mystery box that you cannot receive through the traditional method. It requires you to make an unconventional move to get this box and catch this different pokemon. The process involved to get the meltan box pokemon go include the following:

1. The first and foremost thing you need to do is deport a Pokemon from Pokemon Go to Pokemon Let’s Go. You don’t have to transfer it to your own copy of Let’s Go. A friend’s copy would come in great help here.
2. For making the transfer, you will get a mystery box in Pokemon Go. This box will allow the meltan to run into the wild for about 30 minutes. It gives you the chance to latch the pokemon.
3. If you cannot catch meltan in 30 minutes, you will have to wait and repeat the above process again. As the mystery box will close after 30 minutes, and meltan will vanish from the wild.

## Part 2: How to connect pokemon go to pokemon switch

The trainers with Pokemon let can send Pokemon from Pokemon Go to Nintendo switch. Like transferring the pokemon to Professor Willow, the trainers will earn candy to send their Pokemon to the switch. These pokemons will appear in the Go Park complex of your Pokemon Let’s Go.

Rewarding you for sending Pokemon to the switch, you will receive the meltan box pokemon go. This mystery box will allow you to catch the mythical pokemon.

**Step 4:** When asked, select the option “YES”. This will allow the game to begin the search for a Pokemon Go account that you can pair with.
