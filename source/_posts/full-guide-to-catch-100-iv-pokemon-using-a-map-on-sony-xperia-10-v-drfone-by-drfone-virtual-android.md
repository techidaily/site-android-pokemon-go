## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

## Part 1: Do you know the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball?

![The best ball to catch Pokémon – Pokémon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pokéball that is used to capture Pokémon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.

The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.

The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.

All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.

If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.

You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.

When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:  
**82005274 0001**

You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.

## Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?

There are ways in which you can get unlimited Pokémon Master Balls using the Pokémon emerald Master Ball cheat codes available today.

When you need to level up on Pokémon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

### Mass Raids

Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.

**How do you go about this?**

- Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes
- Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.
- Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.

Do as many of these Raids as you can.

### Mass catching and Mass evolving

You can also catch as many Pokémon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time. This requires that you evolve many Similar Pokémon and they should be cheap to evolve. You can get a lot of XP in this way.

But how do you catch as many Pokémon as possible within a short time?

This is where teleporting tools such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes in. This is a wonderful and powerful tool that allows you to teleport from one area to another without the game realizing that you are spoofing your location.

Needless to say, there are times when players are not able to go outside to catch Pokemons due to all kinds of reasons.

## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.
