![select the teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/catch-croagunk-pokemongo.jpg)

### How to find rare Pokémon or complete your Pokédex?

There are various options you can try to find rare Pokémon and complete your Pokedex.

- **Increase your trainer level.** The higher your trainer level is, the higher your chances of finding a rare Pokémon are. So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.
- **Trade with other players.** If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.
- **Use incense and lures.** Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.
- **Play on the Community Days.** If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!
- **Have friends in other regions.** You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.
- **Use a virtual GPS at home.** If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!

Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?

## 3 Ways for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing On Vivo V30

Pokemon Go is one of the most popular gaming apps of the present times, which is based on augmented reality. Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to [catch Pokemons](https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html), and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android. This would let you change your location and [spoof Pokemon Go on Android](https://www.virtuallocation.com/android-location/) pretty easily.

In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.

![Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?

Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.

If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.

## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020

A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android's features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.

- If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won't sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.
- The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.
- The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.

![Pokemon Go spoofing risks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-2.jpg)

## Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing

As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let's explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.

### 3.1 Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.

Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here's how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.

**Step 1.** Install Pokemon Go on your Vivo V30 and create your account if you haven't already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.

**Step 2.** Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can't detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.

**Step 3.** Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Vivo V30 device again and access the new location.

![vpn for android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg)

### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go

If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Vivo V30 device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Vivo V30 and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your phone's Settings > System > About Phone and tap on the "Build Number" option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.

![Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Vivo V30 device's Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device's location.

![select Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg)

**Step 3.** That's it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.

![launch Pokemon Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg)

If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won't detect its presence. Don't worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.

### 3.3 Use Fake GPS Free

This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won't access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your device's settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.

**Step 2.** Once the app is installed, go to Settings > Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.

![grant Fake GPS access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg)

**Step 3.** Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.

**Step 4.** Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.

![Close the GPS app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-8.jpg)

### The final words

There you go! After following this guide, you would be able to [spoof Pokemon Go](https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/) on Android in three different ways. For your convenience, we have also included the risks of using any Pokemon Go spoofer for Android as well.

## Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Vivo V30

![complete your pokedex with regional pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-1.jpg)

Since its release in 2016, Pokemon GO, Niantic’s viral augmented reality mobile game, has slowly but surely been adding regional Pokemon, exclusive creatures living in specific areas around the globe.

While keeping track of where each regional Pokemon spawns can be pretty confusing, catching these Pokemon poses another challenge. Completing your Pokedex requires a lot of traveling to specific parts of the globe, trading with players who have been there, or waiting for Pokemon GO’s special events.

Alternatively, players can use virtual location-changing tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone, and today, we’ll show you how to catch all **Pokemon GO regional exclusives** with this easy-to-use app.

## Part 1. What Are Regional Pokemon?

Regional Pokemon are exclusive creatures in Niantic’s Pokemon GO AR game that only live in specific regions across the globe. The area in which a particular Pokemon can be found depends on the nature of that Pokemon. For example, Tropius can only be found in tropical parts of the continent.

## Part 2. How Regional Pokemon in Pokemon GO Work

Catching all Pokemon GO regional exclusive creatures and completing your Pokedex is a great challenge. There are multiple ways you can go about it, including some of the following strategies:

- Traveling to specific parts of the world;
- Using Wondershare Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location Changer;
- Waiting for special events that lift distribution restrictions;
- Trading Pokemon with other players from across the globe.

Avid Pokemon trainers can use one or a combination of these strategies to swiftly fill up their Pokedex with complete data about all Pokemon in the wild.

## Part 3. Continents of Regional Pokemon

![regional spawn points in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-2.jpg)

The spawn points of regional Pokemon vary significantly between creatures. Some are exclusive to a hemisphere, others to a continent, while the third group only spawns in a few specific countries. Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that’s why we’ve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.

| **Region** | **Pokemon** |
| --- | --- |
| _Africa_ | Corsola, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Pansear, Throh, Basculin, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Red Flabebe, Furfrou Trim, Oricorio, Kartana, Celesteela |
| _Asia_ | Farfetch’d, Corsola, Volbeat, Torkoal, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pachirisu, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Fabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana Celesteela |
| _Australia_ | Kangaskhan, Corsola, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Celesteela |
| _Europe_ | Mr. Mime, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Mime Jr., Pansear, Sawk, Basculin, Sigilyph, Heatmor, Vivillon, Klefki, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _Middle East_ | Corsola, Tropius, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansear, Basculin, Sawk, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _New Zealand_ | Chatot, Relicanth, Shellos, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmore, Vivillon, Celesteela |
| _North America_ | Tauros, Heracross, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Pachirisu, Shellos, Carnivine, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Bouffalant, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Hawlucha, Oricorio, Comfey, Kartana |
| _South America_ | Heracross, Corsola, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Shellos, Chatot, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Celesteela |

While they’re categorized as available on the entire continent, it’s worth noting that some Pokemon can only be found in particular regions like France or Russia. To learn more about each, you’ll need to find information about their regional distribution.

## Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution

With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.

### Getting Information From the Community

The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.

### Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements

Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.

## Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions

While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.

However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.

Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Here’s how:

1. Download the app from [<u>the official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/)and install it on your computer.



3. Click **Toolbox**in the upper left part of the screen and select **Virtual Location**.

![wondershare dr.fone’s home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

5. Connect your iPhone or Android to the computer via USB or Wi-Fi.
6. Select the **Teleport Mode**in the top right part.

![use dr.fone’s teleport mode feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

8. Type in a location and press **Enter**.

![select a new virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

10. Change your virtual location by clicking the **Move Here**

![move to the selected virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

12. The app’s location will now change on PC.

![verify location change on the computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

14. You should also check your mobile device’s location to confirm it’s changed.

![confirm location change on the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

Wondershare Dr.Fone also includes a Jump Teleport Mode, allowing you to swiftly swap virtual locations and simulate movement along a predestined route. This feature can be remarkably beneficial for Pokemon GO players, and here’s how you can use it:

1. Click the **Jump Teleport Mode**button (the second button in the row).

![select dr.fone’s jump teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/jump-teleport-mode.png)

3. Type in and add multiple virtual locations, and click the **Start Moving**

![move between multiple virtual locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/choose-jump-teleport-destination.png)

5. Switch your virtual location by clicking **Next Point**and **Last Point** to move forward or backward.

![move along the created route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/start-use-jump-teleport-mode.png)

Movement simulation works exceptionally well for catching Pokemon around the globe, and you’ll be able to encounter dozens of these. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone to progress swiftly through the game and catch them all!

## Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events

While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.

The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.

It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.

## Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon

As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.

However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.

## Conclusion

Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.

Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.
