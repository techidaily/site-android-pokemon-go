You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

### 2\. Snorunt

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pok√©mon without Traveling On Oppo A18

The main goal that the designers of Pok√©mon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pok√©mon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pok√©mon enlisted as ‚Äòblanks‚Äô in your Pokedex and you haven‚Äôt yet found them, it‚Äôs probably because they are marked as ‚Äòregional‚Äô types. This means that these Pok√©mon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don‚Äôt Panic! You don‚Äôt have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pok√©mon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pok√©mon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pok√©mon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pok√©mon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pok√©mon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pok√©mon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pok√©mon won‚Äôt become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pok√©mon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch‚Äôd spawned during the 2017 Pok√©mon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pok√©mon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pok√©mon.

List of different Regional Pok√©mon ‚Äì Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pok√©mon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pok√©mon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let‚Äôs get into the list of all the region-specific Pok√©mon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pok√©mon

Catching regionally exclusive Pok√©mon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pok√©mon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pok√©mon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you‚Äôre traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pok√©mon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you‚Äôre actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pok√©mon

Catching regional Pok√©mon is just like catching any regular Pok√©mon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pok√©mon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pok√©mon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pok√©mon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pok√©mon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pok√©mon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pok√©mon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pok√©mon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pok√©mon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pok√©mon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pok√©mon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pok√©mon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pok√©mon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pok√©mon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.
