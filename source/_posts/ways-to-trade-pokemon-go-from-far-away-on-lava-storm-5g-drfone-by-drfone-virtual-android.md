## Part 3: How to do the special trade?

You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It'll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.

## Final Words

However, you could get an upper hand by using a virtual location changer such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) .

**Step 1:** Open the Pokemon Let’s Go app.

**Step 2:** In Fuschia City, talk to the Go Park Complex Attendant and select the “Bring Pokemon” option.

## Part 3: Tips to get more meltan boxes

There is a lot of confusion among the Pokemon trainers regarding how to get meltan in pokemon go. Here, we share a few tips for doing the same and reducing your confusion to zero.

### Tip No.1: Transfer Pokemon to Win a Mystery Box

With the help of pairing and connecting your Pokemon Go to the Nintendo Switch, you can actually get the opportunity to transfer the Pokemon and win a mystery box for yourself.

### Tip No.2: Transfer Pokemon to Friend’s Switch

If you cannot establish a pair with your Nintendo Switch, you can always look for your friends. In case you don’t have a Nintendo Switch with a copy of Let’s Go Pikachu, do not worry. You can still obtain a shiny meltan pokemon go mystery box. You can send Pokemon to your friend’s Nintendo switch and bang… you get the chance to catch the mythical pokemon.

### Tip No.3: Use Dr. Fone Virtual Location Service

You can catch not just one but several Meltans through the mystery box. All you need to do is move around in your area and discover the meltan available near you. But not every time, you can get this lucky to obtain the opportunity to maximize your mystery box. If this is what you are thinking, then we are happy to say that you are wrong!

With the help of [Dr.Fone- Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) service that is developed and designed for iOS devices, you can change your GPS location with just one click.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>



It is well-known that Pokemon Go is a location-based game that offers several services only according to your location. You might find it difficult to maximize your pokemon go meltan box without moving or looking for services out of your region. Dr.Fone Virtual Location is here to help. With this service provider's help, you can change your location and enjoy the unlimited fun that you had always desired. It will also be a great rescue for you if you cannot catch a meltan in your region. Try it and get the Hex Nut Pokemon.

## Conclusion

Resolving your query about getting meltan box and offering you a detailed guide and assistance, we aim to help you continue your fun-experience with the game. Play, look for and find all the meltan! You can then evolve your meltan into a formidable Melmetal. You will need around 400 meltan candy to evolve into Melmetal, so be sure to catch as many as possible and enjoy!
