You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

### Pok√©mon that Evolve with Dawn Stone

As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pok√©mon. To evolve your Pok√©mon using Dawn Stone in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the "Other Items" tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the "Use this item" option. Finally, select the Pok√©mon to evolve. These Pok√©mon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:

### 1\. Kirlia

Kirlia is a small humanoid Pok√©mon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia's natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it‚Äôs not enough. Evolving your Pok√©mon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.

Necessary for certain species of Pok√©mon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive ‚Äì one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.

**Pok√©mon Go Sun Stone evolutions** can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.

## Part 2. Pok√©mon Go Sun Stone Evolutions Explained ![five of the evolution items in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-3.jpg)

Evolutions in Pok√©mon Go aren‚Äôt always the same. You‚Äôll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pok√©mon. Depending on the species, you‚Äôll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don‚Äôt worry, evolutions don‚Äôt affect the total number of Pok√©mon in your collection).

Depending on the specific Pok√©mon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pok√©mon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pok√©mon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pok√©mon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pok√©mon).

You can always check out how to evolve your Pok√©mon in your Pok√©dex.

## Part 4. How to Acquire Sun Stones on Pok√©mon Go ![sun stone and helioptile in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-5.jpg)

While certainly not the rarest evolution item in Pok√©mon Go, that title belonging to the ever-elusive Axew's Unova Stone, the Sun Stone will still make you work for it. Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.

Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pok√©mon evolutions in a few different ways.

### Special Events

Partaking in Pok√©mon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pok√©mon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pok√©mon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:

- Lunar New Year ‚Äì February 5 to February 11;
- Carnival of Love ‚Äì February 13 to February 15;
- Road to Sinnoh ‚Äì February 19 to February 23.

You‚Äôll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll get a Sun Stone, there‚Äôs always a possibility!

### Field Research

Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pok√©mon, so he‚Äôll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you‚Äôll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.

Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a Pok√©Stop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same Pok√©Stop on the same day.

As you‚Äôre completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pok√©mon.

### Special Research

With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit Pok√©Stops when you‚Äôre up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they‚Äôre too difficult for you. With special research, you don‚Äôt have all that much flexibility.

Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can‚Äôt disregard or discard them.

As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you‚Äôll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Gyms and PokeStops

Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and Pok√©Stops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day Pok√©Stop streak, as that will guarantee you‚Äôll get an evolution item.

While you‚Äôll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.

Usually, it‚Äôs in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more Pok√©Stops, as you‚Äôll be able to make more spins faster.

## Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently ![Text‚Äù sun stone in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg)

Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and Pok√©Stops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pok√©mon Go. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.

### Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly

Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.

To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you‚Äôll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pok√©mon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There‚Äôs virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.

Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you‚Äôre out and about while you‚Äôre actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.

You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you‚Äôre moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you‚Äôre using a location spoofer.

To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:



1. Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;
2. Connect your phone to your computer;
3. Go to **Toolbox > Virtual Location > Get Started**;

Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pok√©mon Go on social media or visit the official Pok√©mon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.

You can use [Dr. Fone's Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to mock your location without any movement and obtain these Sinnoh Stones. Dr.Fone's virtual location allows you to mock your location and lets the application on your phone think that you're at a place selected in Dr.Fone's application interface without resulting in any ban or detection from Pokemon Go developers. You can follow the steps listed below in order to catch Pokemon by one click to go anywhere without moving.

**Step 1: Mocking Location Quirk:**

Pokemon Go can be played by using the toolkit of Dr. Fone without shifting. Open the Virtual Location feature using a functioning lightning cable to mock the location and ensure that the iOS device is linked to the application.

You can press the Get Started" button to start the process upon phone detection.

**Step 2: Imitating Movement between steps:**

Open the first choice located in the top-right corner until you enter Dr.Fone's GUI, which helps you to fake movement between the two locations. Select the location pin found in the search bar and press the "Move Here" button.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

You want to make a motion, and navigate to the "March" button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.

For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone's virtual location application.

Click the 'March' button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You'll have to do the Pok√©mon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.
