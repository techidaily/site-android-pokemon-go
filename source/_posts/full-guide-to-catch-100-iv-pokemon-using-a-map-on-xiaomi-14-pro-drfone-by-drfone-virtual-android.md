## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Yes, you read it right! With [Pokemon Go spoofing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), you can catch powerful characters in less time.

![Pokemon Go 100 IV Map introduction](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-1.jpg)

In the following parts, we will discuss in detail the possible ways to catch Pokémon Go IV 100 on the map, including location spoofer.

Keeping reading!

## Part 2: How to Check the IVs of Pokémon?

Before you put effort into catching the Pokémon IV 100 map, you should have knowledge about which Pokémon has a stat of 100 IV. Following are the ways with which you can check the IVs of Pokémon in the Pokémon Go game.

### 2.1 Check IVs within the app

You can check the true percentages of your characters’ IVs in the gaming app itself. Now, if you use the appraisal system of the app, your team leader will show the stats of each Pokémon and can give it a star rating as well.

Further, you can also click on the arrows on the left and right to see the stats of the next Pokémon.

### 2.2 Know Pokémon IV using search filters ![know pokemon iv](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-2.jpg)

Pokémon Go app has a search feature that you can use to know the exact IV of Pokémon. To do this, tap the search icon present at the top of your Pokémon menu. Now in the search bar, type the name of any Pokémon, say type “shiny”. This will show all the shiny mons with different star ratings.

Now check the Pokémon by their star rating, as this is the easy way to know about the IVs of characters. Type “4\*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating. Mostly a star Pokémon are a 100 IV Pokémon map.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

## A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Xiaomi 14 Pro

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.


## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

### 1\. The Silph Road

The Silph Road is the biggest crowd-sourced Pokemon Go map that will let you know about the recently spawning of Pachirisu. Since the directory has data about tons of Pokemons, you can go to its filters and select Pachirisu to save time. This will let you know the recent spawning of the Pokemon with its exact coordinates.

**Website:** [https://thesilphroad.com/](https://thesilphroad.com/)

### 2\. Poke Map

**Website:** [https://www.pokemap.net/](https://www.pokemap.net/)

### 3\. PoGo Map

Earlier, PoGo Map was available as an app, but now you can only use its website to know the spawning of Pokemons. Since it is a global directory, you can easily use it as a Pachirisu map for Pokemon Go. You can zoom in to know the spawn location of Pachirisu with its coordinates or the exact address. Besides Pachirisu, it can also help you catch several other regional Pokemons as well.

**Website:** [https://www.pogomap.info/location/](https://www.pogomap.info/location/)

### 4\. PokeHunter

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application.

Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates.

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.

![virtual location 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

If you want to move naturally, then you can use the GPS joystick that would be enabled at the bottom of the screen. You can use your keyboard shortcuts or the mouse pointer to move in any route realistically.
