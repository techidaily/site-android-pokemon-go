## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

### 3.2 Use a Pokemon Go Joystick APK for Android Devices

Just like iPhone, Android device owners can also implement these Pokemon Go hacks for location spoofing. From all the available options, you can consider using GPS Joystick by App Ninjas. As the name suggests, the app will enable a GPS joystick that you can use to simulate the movement of your device. It will let you fake GPS on Pokemon Go by entering the target coordinates or its address.

**Step 1: Install the Pokemon Go Spoofer APK**

To start with, you can just go to the Play Store page of the GPS Joystick app and install it on your device. Later, you can enable the Developer Options on the phone by going to its Settings > About Phone and tapping the “Build Number” field 7 times.

### 3.3 Pokemon Go Joystick Hack for Rooted Android Phones

Lastly, if you have a rooted Android device, then you can also explore tons of options to fake GPS on Pokemon Go. One of them FGL Pro, which is mostly used by experts for location spoofing and movement simulation. Since the Pokemon Go APK download is available for free, you can use the app without any issue. Here’s how you can use this Pokemon Go APK for rooted devices.

**Step 1: Install the Pokemon Go Spoofer APK**

At first, make sure that your Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G is rooted before you install this Pokemon Go APK hack. Later, you can go to its website or any third-party installer to get the location spoofer app.

You can now launch the application and go to its Settings to enable the Root Mode. Also, make it the default mock location app by visiting the Developer Option on your phone.

**Step 2: Start Simulating the movement of your Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G**

Great! Now, you can just launch the FGL Pro app on your phone and tap on the search icon to look for the target location. You can now adjust the location on the map and tap on the Start icon. There will be a GPS joystick location on the map that would let you simulate your movement accordingly on the map.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

- Make sure that the Pokemon Go joystick you are using is a reliable solution (like the ones listed above).
- If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.

There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solutions that you can explore. While there are plenty of Pokemon Go spoofer APK tools for Android devices, iOS users can try [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). Without the need for jailbreaking your device, it will let you spoof its location and even simulate its movement to catch Pokemons remotely.
