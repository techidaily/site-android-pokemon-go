This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.

### Use Virtual Location to catch the Pokémon Go creature

You can use the faux location of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pokémon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.

**Step 1: Install:**

Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:**

Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

<a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.
