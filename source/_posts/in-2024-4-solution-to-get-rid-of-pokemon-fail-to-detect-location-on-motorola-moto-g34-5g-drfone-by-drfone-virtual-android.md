During leagues, there is a certain limit of using the combat power (CP) of Pokémon. Each league requires Pokémon with different CP restrictions and strategies compared with others.

Moreover, **Pokémon GO PvP** is designed to use an array of Pokémon in a particular league. Notably, you can use only three Pokémon while fighting in a league.

## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League

For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, **Pokémon GO PvP** comes up with CP limitations.

In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:

| **Battle Leagues** | **CP Limit** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pokémon GO Great League** | 1500 CP Limit |
| **Pokémon GO Ultra League** | 2500 CP Limit |
| **Pokémon GO Master League** | No CP limit |

## Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League
