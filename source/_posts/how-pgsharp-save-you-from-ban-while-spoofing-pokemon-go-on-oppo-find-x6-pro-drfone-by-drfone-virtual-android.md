## How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Oppo Find X6 Pro?

Pok√©mon Go is a location-based AR game and is very popular in the world of gaming. Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pok√©mon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg)

For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.

But, spoofing Pok√©mon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.

## Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing

Getting banned for cheating Pok√©mon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg)

**Firstly, punishment:** On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

**Thirdly, Punishment:** On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.

However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pok√©mon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.

### How to find rare Pok√©mon or complete your Pok√©dex?

There are various options you can try to find rare Pok√©mon and complete your Pokedex.

- **Increase your trainer level.** The higher your trainer level is, the higher your chances of finding a rare Pok√©mon are. So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pok√©mon.
- **Trade with other players.** If you have friends who also play Pok√©mon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pok√©mon with them. Just make sure you‚Äôre in a specific range with them.
- **Use incense and lures.** Both of these will help you attract more Pok√©mon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.
- **Play on the Community Days.** If you‚Äôre looking to catch a Shiny Pok√©mon, don‚Äôt forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!
- **Have friends in other regions.** You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pok√©mon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pok√©mon with each other.
- **Use a virtual GPS at home.** If you don‚Äôt have anyone to trade your regional Pok√©mon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pok√©mon!

Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pok√©mon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?
