## Part 3. Explained: Pokemon PvP Ranking in Go Battle League

The lowest Pokemon PvP ranking in the Go Battle League is Rank 1. The ranks go higher as the player accomplishes more battles going forward. However, you have to win each of them if you wish to increase your Battle Ratings quickly. It is important to keep tabs on your ratings because it’s among the crucial components of Pokemon PvP ranking.

![legend gbl rank](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/pokemon-go-pvp-rank-6.JPG)

Go Battle League features a total of 24 ranks starting from Rank 1. The last four high ranks are called Ace, Veteran, Expert, and Legend. With regard to the reward, the set of items that winners will receive varies from one rank to another. More prizes are at stake as you climb the ladder. Thus, work your way up until you become a legend in the Pokemon Go PvP rank battles. You can surely do it. Just trust yourself enough and implement an efficient game plan. By any means possible, it will certainly work magic.

For your information, the Pokemon PvP ranking in the Go Battle League refreshes every season. That means the participants will all go back to Rank 1 once the new season approaches and sets in. Don’t worry. It’s not a big deal. If you’re able to make it last season, you can absolutely do it again one more time. Just stick to your original strategy and be patient at every turn. That’s how you do it.
