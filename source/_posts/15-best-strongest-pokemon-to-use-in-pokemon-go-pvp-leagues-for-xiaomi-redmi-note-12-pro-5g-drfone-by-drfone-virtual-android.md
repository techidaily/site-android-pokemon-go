## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pok√©mon GO PvP League

For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, **Pok√©mon GO PvP** comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pok√©mon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you'll find more legendary Pok√©mon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pok√©mon CP limitation in the Master League.

In addition, these three Pok√©mon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pok√©mon with no CP limit but excludes Pok√©mon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pok√©mon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:

| **Battle Leagues** | **CP Limit** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pok√©mon GO Great League** | 1500 CP Limit |
| **Pok√©mon GO Ultra League** | 2500 CP Limit |
| **Pok√©mon GO Master League** | No CP limit |
