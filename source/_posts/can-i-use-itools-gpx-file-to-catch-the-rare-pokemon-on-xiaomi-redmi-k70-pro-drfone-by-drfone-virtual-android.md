**Step 2: Mirroring Motion amid steps:**

Unfold the top right area of the initial option before reaching Dr. Fone's GUI, which permits you to imitate maneuver amid the two spots. Pick the positioning pin and click on the ‘transfer here’ button in the search bar.

![virtual location 08](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

To begin the replication, you will be required to make a movement and traverse the 'March' button to reach it multiple times. By default, the action is set to one but can be outweighed by the user, and the plan will change correspondingly.

The change location will act as genuine for the Pokémon Go application, and it will presume that the player is moving in between the two points you chose on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the rate of motion can also be modified, making use of the gliding menu. By following these steps, you can use the fake motion of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without needing to understand it, and your app will not be banned.

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also lets you fake your motion joining more than two positions. The attribute is called after the multi-stop path that can be highlighted from the GUI toolbox class situated at the top-right position, which allows you to release several accurate endpoints on the map, and your position will take action correspondingly as managed by the virtual position application of Dr. Fone.

To let the system duplicate flow by choosing the accurate choices, press the 'March' button. You will have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual motion replicator application makes your life a lot easier and lets you do the job without having to worry about travel charges.

## Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape. The next thing you need to do is tap the disc, and it will exhibit a picture of the landmark, which is a chance to get a few free products.

You can get your hands on a dragon scale by spinning a specific Pokestop seven days in a row to get the required streak bonus. This won't ensure you a dragon scale; however, it will give you the possibility of achieving other evolutionary objects such as the Sun Stone, Upgrade, Sinnoh Stone, Unova Stone, Metal Coat, and King's Rock.

## Conclusion

Specific Pokémon in Pokémon GO now call for rare evolution items such as a steel coat, a sunstone, a king's rock, a dragon scale, or an upgrade to evolve, all of which are unplanned drops from Pokestops. However, the players can make use of [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) application to gain version exclusive Pokemon and evolution items and make advancements in the game.
