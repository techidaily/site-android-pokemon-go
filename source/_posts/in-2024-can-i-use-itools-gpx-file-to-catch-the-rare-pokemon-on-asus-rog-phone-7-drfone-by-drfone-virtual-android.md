When you want to fake your location to allow you to play Pokemon Go freely, the first thing to do is unlock your developer options settings.

Go to the **â€˜Settingâ€™**Â menu, which is usually at the top right corner of your interface. Scroll down and click on the **â€˜About Phone.â€™**Â Search for the **â€˜Build numberâ€™** option and click on it. Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification **â€˜You are now a developerâ€™**Â appears.

**Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your Asus ROG Phone 7**

To get the Mock Location option, you go back to the **â€˜Settingsâ€™** menu. Scroll down search for **â€˜Allow Mock Locationsâ€™** and turn it on when you find it. Allow mocking of the Fake GPS app.

**Step 4. Search for your desired location to fake**

Go to your Fake GPS application and search for a preferred location. To initiate the process, hit the **â€˜Searchâ€™** bar.

**Step 5. Confirm your new location**

Lastly, head back to your Pokemon Go app. There, you can see your new location cast.

### Conclusion

All **Pokemon promo codes** have an expiry time frame. And the time frames are usually shorter. Therefore, you need to use them before their due time elapses. Currently, there are no Pokemon promo codes. And for you to continue playing Pokemon Go, you need to involve a third-party tool, and the best tool to use is Dr. Fone Virtual Location.
