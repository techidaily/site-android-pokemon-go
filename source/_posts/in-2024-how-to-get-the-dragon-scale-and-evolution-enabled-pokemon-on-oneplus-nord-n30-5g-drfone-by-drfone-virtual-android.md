## Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape. The next thing you need to do is tap the disc, and it will exhibit a picture of the landmark, which is a chance to get a few free products.

You can get your hands on a dragon scale by spinning a specific Pokestop seven days in a row to get the required streak bonus.

It goes without question that Dr. Fone Virtual Location is the best location spoofer tool. Remember Pokémon game is location-based and if you can play around with your location then you are at an upper hand of grabbing a rare Pokémon or an evolution item like Moon Stone. [Dr. Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) makes it seamless to teleport to any location across the globe while you are seated comfortably at home. Besides, you can simulate movements between two or more points and make GPS control more flexible with the help of a joystick.

**How to Teleport with Dr. Fone Virtual Location**

**Step 1.** After installing Dr. Fone Virtual Location, launch it, and select "Virtual Location." Now connect your iPhone to the computer.

### 2\. Use Android Spoofing Tool- Pgsharp

Pgsharp is a fake GPS location tool for Android devices and is suitable for playing Pokémon from a fake location with no root. It allows users to teleport in real-time while they are just sited at home. It has a downloadable free version. It has a user-friendly interface, and once you have set the fake GPS location on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G, you can catch rare Pokémon and evolution items with ease.

### 3\. Use Go-tcha Evolve

Go-tcha Evolve is an application that allows you to set animations and vibration to alert you in the case of Pokémon or pokestops. You can use its "auto-catch" feature to allow it automatically grab the Pokémon or pokestops without having to respond to alerts.
