### Through Pvp Rewards

One of the best ways to earn Stardust is through Player versus Player features. When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.

For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.

Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.

### By Opening Gifts

Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.

The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.

### By Hatching Pokemon

Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.

You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:

- 400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;
- 600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;
- 800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;
- 1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;
- 3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.

You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.

![eggs in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg)

### By Catching Pokemon

Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.

Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.

If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.

### By Claiming Raid Rewards

When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.

Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.

If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!

### By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks

Each player will get their daily to-do list depending on their skill and game level. Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.

The amount of points you will win depends on the task's difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.

For instance, if you’re on level 45, you can head to the Go Battle League 45 times to earn 4,500 Stardust points.

### By Visiting the Gym

While on your daily walk in the Pokemon world, you should check out whether you can find some Gyms around you. If you do, stop by to hang around with some of the most precious Pokemon characters and give them a berry while you’re there.

You’ll earn 20 Stardust points for each berry you give a Pokemon. It may be the easiest way to earn and use these points for your experience. Plus, you’ll meet new characters and fully experience what the Pokemon world offers.

![regional spawn points in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-2.jpg)

The spawn points of regional Pokemon vary significantly between creatures. Some are exclusive to a hemisphere, others to a continent, while the third group only spawns in a few specific countries. Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that’s why we’ve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.

| **Region** | **Pokemon** |
| --- | --- |
| _Africa_ | Corsola, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Pansear, Throh, Basculin, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Red Flabebe, Furfrou Trim, Oricorio, Kartana, Celesteela |
| _Asia_ | Farfetch’d, Corsola, Volbeat, Torkoal, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pachirisu, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Fabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana Celesteela |
| _Australia_ | Kangaskhan, Corsola, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Celesteela |
| _Europe_ | Mr. Mime, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Mime Jr., Pansear, Sawk, Basculin, Sigilyph, Heatmor, Vivillon, Klefki, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _Middle East_ | Corsola, Tropius, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansear, Basculin, Sawk, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _New Zealand_ | Chatot, Relicanth, Shellos, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmore, Vivillon, Celesteela |

| _South America_ | Heracross, Corsola, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Shellos, Chatot, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Celesteela |

While they’re categorized as available on the entire continent, it’s worth noting that some Pokemon can only be found in particular regions like France or Russia. To learn more about each, you’ll need to find information about their regional distribution.

## Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution

With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.

### Getting Information From the Community

The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.

### Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements

Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.

## Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions

While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.

However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.

Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Here’s how:

1. Download the app from [<u>the official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/)and install it on your computer.



3. Click **Toolbox**in the upper left part of the screen and select **Virtual Location**.

## Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events

While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.

The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.

It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.

## Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon

As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.

However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.

## Conclusion

Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.

Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.
