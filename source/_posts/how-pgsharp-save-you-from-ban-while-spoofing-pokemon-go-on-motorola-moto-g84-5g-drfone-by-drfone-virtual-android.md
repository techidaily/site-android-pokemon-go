## How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Motorola Moto G84 5G?

Pokémon Go is a location-based AR game and is very popular in the world of gaming. Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.

## **Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know**

Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.

- Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.
- They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.
- The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.

## **Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?**

There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS/Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:

- Stay Safe Indoors

    Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.

- Move Beyond your Area

    If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.

- Catch More Pokemons

    One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!

- Level-up in the Game Easily

    From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.

- Have a Better Gaming Experience

    Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.

## **Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?**

While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.

- Account Ban by Niantic

    Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.

    ![Pokemon Go Account Ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg)

    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg)

- Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices

    To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.

- The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down

    Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your iPhone to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.

- It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your iPhone.
- If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.
- The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.
- There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import/export routes as GPX files.

## Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?

The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.

![Pokemon go hacks 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg)

Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.

## Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?

This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:

- Stardust
- As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.
- 1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.

No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:

- Great League Veteran

The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.

## Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?

In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.
