## Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Lava Blaze 2

Are you ready to defeat Giovani effortlessly in Pokemon Go? Keep reading.

Giovani is the grand commander of the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate. The big boss appears stronger every month as he also changes his lineup of creatures monthly. This means your lineup of Pokemon Go Giovani counters would have to change subsequently. So how do you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against the Team Go Rocket boss when next you meet him? Well, that's left for this guide to answer. Here you will learn about how to defeat this monster and how to find him. Without wasting your time, let's start with how to find Giovani in Pokemon.

## Part 1. How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon

Locating Giovani’s hideout is never a walk in the park as you need to complete some daunting tasks. A detailed explanation of each task is given below:

### 1\. A Troubling Situation Task

This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.

How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani

Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1**

This step should be completed with ease since you aren't new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.

**Reward:** 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2**

For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.

**Reward:** 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3**

After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.

**Rewards:** 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4**

For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.

**Rewards:** One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies

### 2\. Giovani Special Research Task

![giovani special research](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani-special-research.jpg)

After completing the quest above, Giovani Special Research or Looming in the Shadows is the next and final quest you have to complete to face Giovani. It's a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.

![a troubling situation task](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg)

On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar. Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag. This reward doesn't only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.

## Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?

Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.

The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.

Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:

| Lineup of Creature | Pokemon |
| --- | --- |
| First | Persian |
| Second | Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp |
| Third | Mewtwo |

For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.

When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.

Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn't just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.

Once you defeat Team Go Rocket's second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn't be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.

Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.

## Part 3. Tips to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go

![giovani](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani.jpg)

Just as you did against Team Go Rocket Leaders, Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra, you need a Pokemon stronger than two of Giovani’s. With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.

Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.

Getting a strong Pokemon won't come with ease, however, with the use of [Dr.Fone- Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) you can achieve this.

## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Lava Blaze 2?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‘vigilante’ does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.
