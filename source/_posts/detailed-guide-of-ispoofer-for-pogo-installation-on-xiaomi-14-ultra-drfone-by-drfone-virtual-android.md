## How to Live-Stream Pokemon Go on Mobile Phones

The primary mechanics of Pokemon Go involve a lot of outdoor strolling and physical movement. For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible. Another thing is that you need to visit the physical location of the PokeStops to spin the Photo Disc. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use mobile devices when streaming Pokemon Go adventures. Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.

### Check your mobile device and internet connection very well

![smartphone and internet power](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-3.JPG)

It’s fair to say that Pokemon Go streaming is not extremely particular when it comes to equipment. You can actually go live under natural daylight and document your adventure as it is. However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.

### Choose a live-streaming application and create an account
