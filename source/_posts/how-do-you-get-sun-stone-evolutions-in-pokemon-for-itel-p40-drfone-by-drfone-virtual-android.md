Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it‚Äôs not enough. Evolving your Pok√©mon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.

Now, while some of your Pok√©mon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pok√©mon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive ‚Äì one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.

**Pok√©mon Go Sun Stone evolutions** can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.

![five of the evolution items in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-3.jpg)

Evolutions in Pok√©mon Go aren‚Äôt always the same. You‚Äôll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pok√©mon. Depending on the species, you‚Äôll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don‚Äôt worry, evolutions don‚Äôt affect the total number of Pok√©mon in your collection).

Depending on the specific Pok√©mon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pok√©mon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pok√©mon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pok√©mon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pok√©mon).

You can always check out how to evolve your Pok√©mon in your Pok√©dex.

![sun stone and helioptile in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-5.jpg)

While certainly not the rarest evolution item in Pok√©mon Go, that title belonging to the ever-elusive Axew's Unova Stone, the Sun Stone will still make you work for it. Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.

Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pok√©mon evolutions in a few different ways.

### Special Events

Partaking in Pok√©mon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pok√©mon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pok√©mon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:

- Lunar New Year ‚Äì February 5 to February 11;
- Carnival of Love ‚Äì February 13 to February 15;
- Road to Sinnoh ‚Äì February 19 to February 23.

You‚Äôll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll get a Sun Stone, there‚Äôs always a possibility!

### Field Research

Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pok√©mon, so he‚Äôll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you‚Äôll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.

Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a Pok√©Stop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same Pok√©Stop on the same day.

As you‚Äôre completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pok√©mon.

### Special Research

With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit Pok√©Stops when you‚Äôre up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they‚Äôre too difficult for you. With special research, you don‚Äôt have all that much flexibility.

Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can‚Äôt disregard or discard them.

As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you‚Äôll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Gyms and PokeStops

Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and Pok√©Stops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day Pok√©Stop streak, as that will guarantee you‚Äôll get an evolution item.

While you‚Äôll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.

Usually, it‚Äôs in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more Pok√©Stops, as you‚Äôll be able to make more spins faster.

![Text‚Äù sun stone in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg)

Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and Pok√©Stops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pok√©mon Go. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.

### Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly

Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.

To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you‚Äôll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pok√©mon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There‚Äôs virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.

Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you‚Äôre out and about while you‚Äôre actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.

You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you‚Äôre moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you‚Äôre using a location spoofer.

1. Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;

### Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events

Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you‚Äôll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pok√©mon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you‚Äôll always want to know precisely when they start and end.

Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pok√©mon Go on social media or visit the official Pok√©mon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.

## Conclusion

Acquiring Sun Stones for Pok√©mon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone ‚Äì especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.

## Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Itel P40

![complete your pokedex with regional pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-1.jpg)

Since its release in 2016, Pokemon GO, Niantic‚Äôs viral augmented reality mobile game, has slowly but surely been adding regional Pokemon, exclusive creatures living in specific areas around the globe.

While keeping track of where each regional Pokemon spawns can be pretty confusing, catching these Pokemon poses another challenge. Completing your Pokedex requires a lot of traveling to specific parts of the globe, trading with players who have been there, or waiting for Pokemon GO‚Äôs special events.

Alternatively, players can use virtual location-changing tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone, and today, we‚Äôll show you how to catch all **Pokemon GO regional exclusives** with this easy-to-use app.

## Part 1. What Are Regional Pokemon?

Regional Pokemon are exclusive creatures in Niantic‚Äôs Pokemon GO AR game that only live in specific regions across the globe. The area in which a particular Pokemon can be found depends on the nature of that Pokemon. For example, Tropius can only be found in tropical parts of the continent.

## Part 2. How Regional Pokemon in Pokemon GO Work

Catching all Pokemon GO regional exclusive creatures and completing your Pokedex is a great challenge. There are multiple ways you can go about it, including some of the following strategies:

- Traveling to specific parts of the world;
- Using Wondershare Dr.Fone‚Äôs Virtual Location Changer;
- Waiting for special events that lift distribution restrictions;
- Trading Pokemon with other players from across the globe.

Avid Pokemon trainers can use one or a combination of these strategies to swiftly fill up their Pokedex with complete data about all Pokemon in the wild.

![regional spawn points in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-2.jpg)

The spawn points of regional Pokemon vary significantly between creatures. Some are exclusive to a hemisphere, others to a continent, while the third group only spawns in a few specific countries. Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.

| **Region** | **Pokemon** |

## Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution

With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don‚Äôt necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.

### Getting Information From the Community

The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements

Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO‚Äôs regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.

## Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions

While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic‚Äôs viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.

However, there‚Äôs also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.

Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Download the app from [<u>the official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/)and install it on your computer.

Movement simulation works exceptionally well for catching Pokemon around the globe, and you‚Äôll be able to encounter dozens of these. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone to progress swiftly through the game and catch them all!

## Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events

While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn‚Äôt the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO‚Äôs regional exclusive creatures.

The game‚Äôs special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.

It‚Äôs worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You‚Äôll need to pay close attention to the game‚Äôs announcements, as you don‚Äôt want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.

## Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon

As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.

However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There‚Äôll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.

## Conclusion

Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic‚Äôs viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO‚Äôs regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who‚Äôve visited these areas, or wait for the game‚Äôs special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.

Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device‚Äôs GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.

So There are basically 4 levels of friendship in Pokemon go

- Friend
- Good friend
- Ultra friend
- Best friend

The levels of your friendship with a player on Pokemon go increase with the increase in the number of days you stay friends with them. Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.

## Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?

Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common.
