iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that‚Äôs designed to simulate a user's GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you‚Äôre one of them, this guide will help. In today‚Äôs article, we are going to discuss if you can download **iSpoofer for Android**¬†or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.

So, without any further ado, let‚Äôs get started.

## ****Part 1: ¬†Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****

Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn‚Äôt available for Android. It‚Äôs an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won‚Äôt be able to download **iSpoofer for Android**¬†at all.

However, the good news is that you don‚Äôt need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that‚Äôll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you‚Äôll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.

## ****Part 2: ¬†Common ways to spoof on Android****

When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you‚Äôll have to be extra cautious. _Why?_ Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren‚Äôt reliable and may damage your smartphone‚Äôs overall functionality as well.

Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.

1. **Use VMOS**

VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you‚Äôll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you‚Äôll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.

<a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png" border="0">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![vmos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg)

The only downside of using VMOS is that it‚Äôs extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you‚Äôll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn‚Äôt have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.

2. **Root Your Device**

Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you‚Äôll root your device, you won‚Äôt be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don‚Äôt want to void your smartphone‚Äôs warranty, ‚Äòrooting‚Äô may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.

3. **Use PGSharp**

PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to **iSpoofer for Android**. It‚Äôs a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it‚Äôs compatible with all Android devices. You won‚Äôt have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.

**Note:** Keep in mind that PGSharp isn‚Äôt available on Google Play Store and you‚Äôll have to download it from the official [<u>PGSharp website</u>](https://www.pgsharp.com/).

## **Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location**

So, that‚Äôs how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn‚Äôt available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone/iPad, you‚Äôll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It‚Äôs a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Tecno Pop 8s.

It has a dedicated ‚ÄúTeleport Mode‚Äù that‚Äôll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, [<u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)¬†also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you‚Äôll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

- Change your current location with a single click
- Use GPS coordinates to find locations
- Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature
- Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions
- Compatible with all iOS versions

Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

Step 1 - Install the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and launch the software. Click ‚ÄúVirtual Location‚Äù and connect your iPhone to the computer using a lightning cable.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3 - You‚Äôll be prompted to a map that‚Äôll point to your current location. Select ‚ÄúTeleport Mode‚Äù from the top-right corner and use the search bar to find the desired location.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4 - The pointer will move to the selected location automatically. Finally, click ‚ÄúMove Here‚Äù to set it as your new location.

That‚Äôs how you can change GPS location on an iPhone/iPad using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).
