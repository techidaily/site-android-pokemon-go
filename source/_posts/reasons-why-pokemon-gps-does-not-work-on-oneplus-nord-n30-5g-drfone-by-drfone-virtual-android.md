## Part 4: How to Cheat at Pokemon Go

The Pokemon Go promo code is not usually available at all times. However, this should not limit your play. You don’t necessarily have to move around for you to catch the Pokemon. You can still enjoy playing Pokemon Go in your comfort. You, therefore, have to involve a third-party tool. And the best software tool to use is Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool is an award-winning professional tool that allows you to teleport effortlessly. The key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location are:

- It has instant teleportation. It helps in concealing your GPS location
- It has a full-screen HD map view
- It has a joystick tool that comfortably allows you to spoof your location
- It will enable you to spoof your GRS location with a single click



Faking GPS location in iPhone devices differs from Android devices.

**iPhone devices --**

Here are the simple steps of using Dr. Fone - Virtual Location in faking your location on Pokemon Go on the iPhone.

**Step 1. Launch Dr. Fone Virtual Location to your computer.**

![install dr. fone to start faking gps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

First, download Dr.Fone - Virtual location from their [<u>official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). Install and allow it to run on your computer device. Click on the **‘Virtual Location’** option to initiate the process of faking your GPS.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![connect your phone and start to change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Using a USB cable, connect your iPhone to your computer system. Hit the **‘Get started’** button to continue.

**Step 3. Search for a location**

![search for a location to fake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Here, you need to search for a suitable location that you would like to teleport to. Hit the **‘teleport**’ option from the toolbar at the top-right corner of the interface.

**Step 4. Teleport to your desired location**

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Various options of places you would like to teleport to will be there on display. You can search for it using the search bar or select one from the displayed list and hit the **‘Go’** icon.

**Step 5. Teleport to your chosen location**

For you to teleport to your chosen location, you need to drop a pin on your preferred place and hit the **‘Move Here’** icon. Now, you will be able to catch more Pokemon since you have already altered your location.

![ideal location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)



**Android Phones --**

Faking location on Android phones is undoubtedly more straightforward than on iPhones. In Android phones, hacking the GPS location does not necessarily involve using a computer device.

Here are the simple steps of how to fake your GPS location on Android devices.

**Step 1.  Enable the developer options**

![enable option to let developer mode be turned on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-11.jpg)

When you want to fake your location to allow you to play Pokemon Go freely, the first thing to do is unlock your developer options settings.

Go to the **‘Setting’** menu, which is usually at the top right corner of your interface. Scroll down and click on the **‘About Phone.’** Search for the **‘Build number’** option and click on it. Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification **‘You are now a developer’** appears.

**Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your OnePlus Nord N30 5G**

![download the fake gps location on your Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-13.jpg)

Go to the Google Play Store and download Fake GPS Location to your OnePlus Nord N30 5G. Install it and allow it to run on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G.

**Step 3. Allow mock location**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![wa stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-12.jpg)

To get the Mock Location option, you go back to the **‘Settings’** menu. Scroll down search for **‘Allow Mock Locations’** and turn it on when you find it. Allow mocking of the Fake GPS app.

**Step 4. Search for your desired location to fake**

Go to your Fake GPS application and search for a preferred location. To initiate the process, hit the **‘Search’** bar.

**Step 5. Confirm your new location**

![search and confirm your new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokemon-go-fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

Lastly, head back to your Pokemon Go app. There, you can see your new location cast.

### Conclusion

All **Pokemon promo codes** have an expiry time frame. And the time frames are usually shorter. Therefore, you need to use them before their due time elapses. Currently, there are no Pokemon promo codes. And for you to continue playing Pokemon Go, you need to involve a third-party tool, and the best tool to use is Dr. Fone Virtual Location.
