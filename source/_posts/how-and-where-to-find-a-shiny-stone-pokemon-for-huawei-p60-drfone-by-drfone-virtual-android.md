![pokemon pvp battles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg)

### 1\. Great League

The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.

### 2\. Ultra League

The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.

In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.

### 3\. Master League

The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.

Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina. However, they are powerful competitors and key contributors to the Master League.

## Part 4. Some Helpful Tips and Tricks To Win Pokémon GO PvP League

In this section, we will help you learn some useful tips and tricks that you can perform to win a PvP league. An important one of them is always choosing the **best PvP Pokémon**, but let's look at some other tips, too.

1. **Make an Organized Team:**You must create a well-rounded team that covers various types and vulnerabilities. Also, consider countering the weaknesses of key Pokémon in your team to increase your chances of success.
2. **Assign Roles to Each Pokémon:**Once you have made a team, designate a lead Pokémon to set the tempo of the battle. Plus, always keep a safe switch Pokémon for unfavorable situations. A good strategy is to use closer Pokémon for end-game scenarios, ensuring they can withstand attacks and deal significant damage.
3. **Unlock a Second Charged Move:**Always try to acquire a second charged move for your Pokémon to gain a strategic advantage. You can use the second move to counter specific threats or bait shields, influencing the outcome of the match.
4. **Master Switching Strategies:**You must know when to switch Pokémon based on type advantages and the opponent's likely moves. Also, avoid switching unnecessarily to prevent opponents from capitalizing on type advantages.
