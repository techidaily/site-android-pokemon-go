![The best ball to catch Pok√©mon ‚Äì Pok√©mon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pok√©mon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pok√©ball that is used to capture Pok√©mon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pok√©mon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pok√©balls that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù written on it, which possibly means ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù.

The Pok√©mon master ball emerald will capture all Pok√©mon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pok√©mon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pok√©ball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pok√©mon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pok√©mon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pok√©mon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pok√©ball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pok√©mon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.
