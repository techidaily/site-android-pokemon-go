Fate works in mysterious ways. We never know what’s waiting ahead. One day, you’re just an ordinary Pokemon Go player who enjoys catching Pokemon around the neighborhood.

Hence, don’t ever underestimate the power of this venture.

## How to Live-Stream Pokemon Go on Mobile Phones

The primary mechanics of Pokemon Go involve a lot of outdoor strolling and physical movement. For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible.

Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.

### Check your mobile device and internet connection very well

You want to make a motion, and navigate to the "March" button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.

The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone's virtual location application.

Click the 'March' button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You'll have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.
