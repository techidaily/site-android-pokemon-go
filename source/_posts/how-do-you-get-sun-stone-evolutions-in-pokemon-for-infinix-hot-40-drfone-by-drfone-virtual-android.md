## How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Infinix Hot 40?

![pokémon go sun stone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions.jpg)

Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pokémon in Pokémon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it’s not enough. Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.

Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.

**Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions** can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.

## Part 1. What Are Sun Stones in Pokémon Go?

![sun stone and four pokémon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-2.jpg)

The Sun Stone is one of eight evolution items you’ll need in Pokémon Go. Glowing bright red and orange, it is effortless to recognize in the game, immediately catching your eye even in the busiest of environments. Consider yourself lucky if you come across one casually.

## Part 2. Pokémon Go Sun Stone Evolutions Explained

![five of the evolution items in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-3.jpg)

Evolutions in Pokémon Go aren’t always the same. You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).

Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).

You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.

## Part 3. Which Pokémon Evolve With Sun Stones?

![sunken and sunflora in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-4.jpg)

Every Pokémon you come across in the game is different, and they’ll all have varying evolution requirements. Considering how elusive the Sun Stone can be, it’s great that only a few Pokémon require it. Check out the following Pokémon Sun Stone evolution list.

### Pokémon Sun Stone Evolution List

| **Pokémon** | **Items Needed** | **Sun Stone Evolutions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gloom | Sun Stone and 100 Oddish candy | Bellossom |
| Sunkern | Sun Stone and 50 Sunkern candy | Sunflora |
| Cottonee | Sun Stone and 50 Cottonee candy | Whimsicott |
| Petilil | Sun Stone and 50 Petilil candy | Lilligant |
| Helioptile | Sun Stone and 50 Helioptilecandy | Heliolisk |

## Part 4. How to Acquire Sun Stones on Pokémon Go

![sun stone and helioptile in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-5.jpg)

While certainly not the rarest evolution item in Pokémon Go, that title belonging to the ever-elusive Axew's Unova Stone, the Sun Stone will still make you work for it. Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.

Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pokémon evolutions in a few different ways.

### Special Events

Partaking in Pokémon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:

- Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;
- Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;
- Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.

You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!

### Field Research

Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.

Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.

As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.

### Special Research

With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.

Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.

As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.

### Gyms and PokeStops

Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.

While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.

Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.

## Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently

![Text” sun stone in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg)

Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and PokéStops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pokémon Go. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.

### Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly

Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.

To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.

Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.

You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.

To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:



1. Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;
2. Connect your phone to your computer;
3. Go to **Toolbox > Virtual Location > Get Started**;

![get started with wondershare dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

4. On the map that shows up, click on **No Device**in the upper right-hand corner;
5. You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;

![choose the Infinix Hot 40 device you want to connect to dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png)

6. On your phone, tap **Allow USB Debugging**;
7. On your phone, go to **Developer Options> Select mock location app**;
8. Select **Fone**.

![set up mock location on your phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png)

From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement. With Wondershare Dr.Fone, you’ll have intuitive keyboard controls, 360-degree directions, and automated movement. So, as soon as you set things up in the app, you can start playing the game, completing your field research tasks, and, hopefully, acquiring your Sun Stones.

### Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events

Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you’ll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.

Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.

## Conclusion

Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone – especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.



## Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Infinix Hot 40

_**“How to plan the PvP Pokemon matches and are there some strategies that I need to implement in the PoGo PvP battles?”**_

Ever since the Pokemon Go PvP mode has been introduced by Nintendo, there has been a lot of confusion among the players. Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.

![pokemon pvp battle tips banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles

If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.

### Tip 1: Start from the low leagues

As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:

- **Great League:** Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)
- **Ultra League:** Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)
- **Master League:** No CP limit

![leagues in pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.

### Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves

Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.

- **Fast attacks:** These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.
- **Charge attack:** Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.
- **Shield:** This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.
- **Swapping:** Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.

![moves in pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons

This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.

![opponent screen pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 4: Know the current Meta

In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.

There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.

### Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy

This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.

Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.

![shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves

To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.

During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.

![fast moves in pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap

This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.

In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.

## Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?

Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.

- The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.
- Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.
- Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.
- The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.
- The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.

![cp iv level trick pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?

During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.

- **Team composition**

Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.

- **Focus on attacks**

Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.

- **Consider Pokemon Stats**

Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.

![meta pokemons in pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg)

Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.

- **Lead**

Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.

- **Attacker**

If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.

- **Defender**

While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.

- **Closer**

In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.

![skarmory in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg)

## Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles

Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.

- **Turns**

Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.

- **Energy**

You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.

- **Switching**

Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.

![mechanism in pokemon pvp battle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg)

There you go! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know every important thing about PvP Poke battles. From the meta Pokemons for PvP battles to essential mechanisms, I have listed it all in this guide. Now, it is time for you to implement these tips and become a Pokemon Go PvP champion in no time!



## How to use iSpoofer on Infinix Hot 40?

iSpoofer is a location spoofer that allows you to change your location on your device. This is useful for games like Pokemon Go, where you can catch Pokemons from different regions without leaving your home. However, iSpoofer is not available for download anymore. If you are looking for an alternative to iSpoofer, you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to spoof your location on your Infinix Hot 40.

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that’s designed to simulate a user's GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download **iSpoofer for Android** or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.

So, without any further ado, let’s get started.

- [Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1)
- [Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2)

## ****Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****

Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download **iSpoofer for Android** at all.

However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.

## ****Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android****

When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. _Why?_ Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.

Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.

1. **Use VMOS**

VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.

![vmos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg)

The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.

2. **Root Your Device**

Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.

3. **Use PGSharp**

PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to **iSpoofer for Android**. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.

**Note:** Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official [<u>PGSharp website</u>](https://www.pgsharp.com/).

## **Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location**

So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.

It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone/iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Infinix Hot 40s.

It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, [<u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

- Change your current location with a single click
- Use GPS coordinates to find locations
- Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature
- Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions
- Compatible with all iOS versions

Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

Step 2 - Once the tool recognizes your device, click “Get Started” to proceed further.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3 - You’ll be prompted to a map that’ll point to your current location. Select “Teleport Mode” from the top-right corner and use the search bar to find the desired location.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4 - The pointer will move to the selected location automatically. Finally, click “Move Here” to set it as your new location.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)
