- **Step 1.** **Activate Teleport Mode in Dr.Fone - Virtual Location**

Open Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, connect your smartphone with an original USB cable, and choose the "Teleport Mode" option located in the top-right section.

To simulate movement, navigate to the top-right section and click “One-Stop Route.” It is the third icon from the left. After moving to the desired location, tap anywhere on the map to designate your destination. Specify the number of round trips and opt for either a Round or Loop trip.

- **Step 4.** **Enable the Multi-Stop Route Feature**

If you want to visit more than one stop, enable the Multi-Stop Route mode. You can do it by accessing the top-right section adjacent to the One-Stop Route mode. Once activated, designate multiple locations on the map by selecting your desired points. Specify the number of trips and speed settings. Initiate the process by clicking on "Start Moving." During the simulation, you can "Pause" the sequence at any point.
