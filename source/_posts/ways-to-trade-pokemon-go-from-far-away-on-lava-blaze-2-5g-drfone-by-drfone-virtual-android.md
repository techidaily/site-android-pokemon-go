However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.

### Choose a live-streaming application and create an account

![streaming platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-4.JPG)

Pick the best one, and then create your Pokemon Go streaming account. Optimize your profile and make sure that the details are complete.

## What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Lava Blaze 2 5G?

If you are a diehard Pokémon Go player, you probably know how exciting it is when your Pokémon evolves. Evolutions mean a boost in stats and strength in raids. Plenty of Pokémon users are conversant with the traditional raiding as a way to evolve. However, you can use special items to evolve your Pokémon. One such item is the dawn stone. In this article, we are going to take you through a detailed guide on dawn stone evolutions and how to get it with ease.

## Part 1. Dawn Stone Pokémon Evolutions

### What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?

Like Shiny Stone, dusk stone, Sun Stone, and Moon Stone, Dawn Stone is another peculiar evolution item in Pokémon Sword and Shield. If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.

![dawn stone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dawn-stone.jpg)

You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

### Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone

As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the "Other Items" tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the "Use this item" option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:

### 1\. Kirlia

Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia's natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

### 2\. Snorunt

Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the "Snow Hat Pokémon." You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.

## Part 2. Hacks and Tricks to get Dawn Stone Pokémon

It is every player's wish to avoid the long hunt for a Dawn Stone into their Podex. This issue has given birth to some of the hacks and tricks to help players cross territory and find the intended evolution item or Pokémon. Some of these tricks include:

### 1\. Use iOS spoofing tool- Dr. Fone Virtual Location
