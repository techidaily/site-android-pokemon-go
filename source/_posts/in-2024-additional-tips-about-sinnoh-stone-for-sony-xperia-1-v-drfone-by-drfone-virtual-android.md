Sinnoh Stone can be obtained during the battle against the three leaders on Community Day, on the completion of the final day of your 7-day Research Task, and During PVP. You won't be finding them at Poke Stops. Main places where you can find Sinnoh Stones are on the 7th Day of your Research Task and award for taking part in PVP. Another place that is not popular but odds to find Sinnoh Stone is present includes the introduction to PVP when you're new to it. Players can obtain up to 10 Sinnoh Stones during the February Community Day and when the month is Pokemon Go Community Day. 5 Sinnoh Stones can be obtained by beating the three leaders in the battles and another 5 from winning PVP battles against friends. Defeating a Team Go Rocket Leader and Go Battle Reward is Sinnoh Stone.

You can use [Dr. Fone's Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to mock your location without any movement and obtain these Sinnoh Stones. Dr.Fone's virtual location allows you to mock your location and lets the application on your phone think that you're at a place selected in Dr.Fone's application interface without resulting in any ban or detection from Pokemon Go developers. You can follow the steps listed below in order to catch Pokemon by one click to go anywhere without moving.

**Step 1: Mocking Location Quirk:**

Pokemon Go can be played by using the toolkit of Dr. Fone without shifting. Open the Virtual Location feature using a functioning lightning cable to mock the location and ensure that the iOS device is linked to the application.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

You can press the Get Started" button to start the process upon phone detection.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Imitating Movement between steps:**

Open the first choice located in the top-right corner until you enter Dr.Fone's GUI, which helps you to fake movement between the two locations. Select the location pin found in the search bar and press the "Move Here" button.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

You want to make a motion, and navigate to the "March" button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone's virtual location application.

Click the 'March' button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You'll have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.

## Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon's Using Sinnoh Stone

Only the trainers above the 10th Level have access to acquire Sinnoh Stone. The Sinnoh Stone can be obtained from Training Battles and Training with Team Leaders. You also need 100 candies for each of the Pokemon. Once you have got your hands on Sinnoh Stones and now you want to know where they should be used, there’s numerous 4th generation Pokémon who require Sinnoh Stone for their upgrade. Mamoswine is one of the best if you're prioritizing attackers for a raid because it has a mix of extremely high CP with the strong ground and ice-type moves.

## Why is iPogo not working On Sony Xperia 1 V? Fixed

The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.

### Why Users download iPogo?

iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;

- The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.
- With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.
- If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.
- You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.
- If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.
- You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.

With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.

## Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working

Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Sony Xperia 1 V device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.

Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.

Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;

- One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.
- Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.
- Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.

### Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue

It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.

- **Limiting the usage of System Resources:** Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.
- **Too many Items opened:** Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.
- **Keep you Device Clean:** Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.
- **Install the Official Version:** It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.

**Method 1:** Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.

**Method 2:** If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.

**Method 3:** The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.

**Note:** All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.

Just go to its website to access the map of various Pokemon Go Discord servers. You can zoom in/out the map and even move the pin around to find various servers.

## Pro Tip: Spoof your iPhone Location to Play Pokemon Go Remotely

From these Pokemon Go Discord servers, you can easily know the spawning or raid locations for the game. Later, you can use a tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to spoof the GPS of your iOS device. Just connect your iPhone to the computer and enter the target location’s address or its exact coordinates. You can also use it to simulate the movement of your device in a route realistically via a GPS joystick. The best part is that the application is super-easy to use and will not need jailbreak access on your phone.
