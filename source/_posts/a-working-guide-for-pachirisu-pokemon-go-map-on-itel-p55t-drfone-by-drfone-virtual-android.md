## A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Itel P55T

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.


## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

### 1\. The Silph Road

The Silph Road is the biggest crowd-sourced Pokemon Go map that will let you know about the recently spawning of Pachirisu. Since the directory has data about tons of Pokemons, you can go to its filters and select Pachirisu to save time. This will let you know the recent spawning of the Pokemon with its exact coordinates.

**Website:** [https://thesilphroad.com/](https://thesilphroad.com/)

### 2\. Poke Map

If you are looking for an active Pachirisu Pokemon Go map, then you can head to this freely available website. You can know the active regions where the Pokemon has been found recently. Not just that, it will also let you know about other details of the game like raids, Pokestops, gyms, etc.

**Website:** [https://www.pokemap.net/](https://www.pokemap.net/)

### 3\. PoGo Map

Earlier, PoGo Map was available as an app, but now you can only use its website to know the spawning of Pokemons. Since it is a global directory, you can easily use it as a Pachirisu map for Pokemon Go. You can zoom in to know the spawn location of Pachirisu with its coordinates or the exact address. Besides Pachirisu, it can also help you catch several other regional Pokemons as well.

**Website:** [https://www.pogomap.info/location/](https://www.pogomap.info/location/)

### 4\. PokeHunter

PokeHunter is a well-known Pokemon GO tracker that provides exact information on PokeStops and gyms. It will inform you about the Pachirisu, ex-Raid battles, and locations of other Pokémon characters. With real-time tracking, it is accessible to all devices, such as PCs and mobile phones. Besides, this map can show the energy level of Pokemon and let you decide which to catch.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Teleport to any other location**

After when your device is detected, Dr.Fone will automatically display its exact location on the screen. You can now go to the Teleport Mode from the top-right to spoof your location.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, go to the search bar and just enter the address of the target location or its coordinates that you can get from a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Simply adjust the pin on the map so that you can drop it to the desired spot. Click on the “Move Here” button in the end to spoof your iPhone location.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.

![virtual location 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

If you want to move naturally, then you can use the GPS joystick that would be enabled at the bottom of the screen. You can use your keyboard shortcuts or the mouse pointer to move in any route realistically.

## Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Itel P55T

Are you ready to defeat Giovani effortlessly in Pokemon Go? Keep reading.

Giovani is the grand commander of the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate. The big boss appears stronger every month as he also changes his lineup of creatures monthly. This means your lineup of Pokemon Go Giovani counters would have to change subsequently. So how do you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against the Team Go Rocket boss when next you meet him? Well, that's left for this guide to answer. Here you will learn about how to defeat this monster and how to find him. Without wasting your time, let's start with how to find Giovani in Pokemon.

## Part 1. How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon

Locating Giovani’s hideout is never a walk in the park as you need to complete some daunting tasks. A detailed explanation of each task is given below:

### 1\. A Troubling Situation Task

This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.

How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani

Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1**

This step should be completed with ease since you aren't new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.

**Reward:** 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2**

For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.

**Reward:** 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3**

After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.

**Rewards:** 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4**

For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.

**Rewards:** One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies

### 2\. Giovani Special Research Task

![giovani special research](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani-special-research.jpg)

After completing the quest above, Giovani Special Research or Looming in the Shadows is the next and final quest you have to complete to face Giovani. It's a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.

![a troubling situation task](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg)

On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar. Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag. This reward doesn't only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.

## Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?

Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.

The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.

Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:

| Lineup of Creature | Pokemon |
| --- | --- |
| First | Persian |
| Second | Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp |
| Third | Mewtwo |

For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.

When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.

Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn't just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.

Once you defeat Team Go Rocket's second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn't be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.

Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.

## Part 3. Tips to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go

![giovani](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani.jpg)

Just as you did against Team Go Rocket Leaders, Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra, you need a Pokemon stronger than two of Giovani’s. With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.

Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.

Getting a strong Pokemon won't come with ease, however, with the use of [Dr.Fone- Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) you can achieve this.
