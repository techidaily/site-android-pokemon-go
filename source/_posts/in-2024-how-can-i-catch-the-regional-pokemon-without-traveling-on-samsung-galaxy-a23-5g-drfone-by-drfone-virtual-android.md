## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Samsung Galaxy A23 5G

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Samsung Galaxy A23 5G

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device’s location.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your iPhone location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your iPhone anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.

1. The first and foremost thing you need to do is deport a Pokemon from Pokemon Go to Pokemon Let’s Go. You don’t have to transfer it to your own copy of Let’s Go. A friend’s copy would come in great help here.
2. For making the transfer, you will get a mystery box in Pokemon Go. This box will allow the meltan to run into the wild for about 30 minutes. It gives you the chance to latch the pokemon.
3. If you cannot catch meltan in 30 minutes, you will have to wait and repeat the above process again. As the mystery box will close after 30 minutes, and meltan will vanish from the wild.
