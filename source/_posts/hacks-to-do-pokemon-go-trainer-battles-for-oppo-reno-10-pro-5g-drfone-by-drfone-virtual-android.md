## Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?

In Pok√©mon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pok√©mon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pok√©mon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pok√©mon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pok√©mon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pok√©mon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pok√©mon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pok√©mon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pok√©mon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pok√©mon also affect the CP score so you need a Pok√©mon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.
