## Things You Need to Know About Pokemon Go Streaming

In all actuality, Pokemon Go streaming is not different from other forms of live game streaming. You just play the game as usual and interact with your viewers throughout the duration. However, we cannot deny that Pokemon Go streaming has a more challenging format compared to others. Why so? Simply because the game itself requires large body movements and a few physical activities. But don’t sweat it. Streaming Pokemon Go online comes with tons of benefits. Check out the list below to find what exactly you can get from this endeavor.

### It can provide an alternative source of income

![pokemon go streaming live](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-1.JPG)

You can earn a specific amount from every ad that appears on your livestream. Don’t worry. It doesn’t take much time and effort to implement. Most of the time, you just need to flash the promotional materials during the broadcast.

As you get exposed to such arrangements over and over, your cognitive performance further improves, too.

Fate works in mysterious ways. We never know what’s waiting ahead. One day, you’re just an ordinary Pokemon Go player who enjoys catching Pokemon around the neighborhood. The next, you’re a star trainer competing globally for championship events. That’s possible to happen with Pokemon Go streaming as your ultimate stepping stone. Hence, don’t ever underestimate the power of this venture.

## How to Live-Stream Pokemon Go on Mobile Phones

The primary mechanics of Pokemon Go involve a lot of outdoor strolling and physical movement. For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible. Another thing is that you need to visit the physical location of the PokeStops to spin the Photo Disc. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use mobile devices when streaming Pokemon Go adventures. Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.

### Check your mobile device and internet connection very well

![smartphone and internet power](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-3.JPG)

It’s fair to say that Pokemon Go streaming is not extremely particular when it comes to equipment. You can actually go live under natural daylight and document your adventure as it is. However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.

### Choose a live-streaming application and create an account

![streaming platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-4.JPG)

Of course, you can bring a full computer setup outside while exploring around. That’s why you should choose a live-streaming application with features that allow you to broadcast directly on Your Oppo Reno 9A. Don’t worry. There are lots of choices on the internet. Pick the best one, and then create your Pokemon Go streaming account. Optimize your profile and make sure that the details are complete.

Play Pokemon Go as if nobody is watching you online. Simply put, carry on with your usual gaming routine. Don’t let the audience distract you from the game.

The point is that you have to extend the actual Pokemon Go experience to them. Trust yourself. You can definitely do that.

## Important Tips When Streaming Pokemon Go Online

The best tip that anyone can give you is to be yourself when you livestream Pokemon Go. Don’t hide behind false pretense just to portray someone you know you’re not.

Check out the list below.

![pokemon go livestream tips](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-7.JPG)

- Consider your safety as the primary priority. Stay alert and keep your essential belongings within your sight. You never know. People with ill intentions are just around the corners of the street. Hence, keep yourself safe from this kind of situation that may put your life in real danger.
- One way to broaden your online exposure is to go live on a regular and consistent timetable. Plan ahead the exact schedule of your Pokemon Go livestream and announce it on your official social media handles.
- Adhere to the rules and policies implemented not only by Pokemon Go but also by your chosen platform. Don’t break any of them because such actions can affect your progress as a player and streamer.
- Take constructive feedback positively. Yes. Expect that once you go live on the internet, you will receive various kinds of reactions from other people. But don’t let them get into your head as much as possible. Keep your head high and work on the improvements at your own pace.

## Part 3: How to do the special trade?

You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It'll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.

## **Part 1: Where can I find the Best Pokemon Go Discord Servers?**

Ideally, there are hundreds of Discord servers dedicated to Pokemon Go that you can find. Since it is not possible to join so many servers, I would recommend considering the following options to pick some appropriate Pokemon Discord servers.

1. **The Silph Road**

The Silph Road has to be the biggest user-driven community that is dedicated to Pokemon Go out there. Apart from Pokemon spawning locations and other secrets, you can also use it to find a Pokemon Go Discord server near you.

Just go to its website to access the map of various Pokemon Go Discord servers. You can zoom in/out the map and even move the pin around to find various servers.

_Website:_ [_https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/_](https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/)
