### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

## How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Nokia 130 Music?

Pokémon Go is a location-based AR game and is very popular in the world of gaming. Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg)

For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.

But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.

## Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing

Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.

**Firstly, punishment:** On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

**Thirdly, Punishment:** On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.

However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.
