## Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?

Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.

If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.

## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020

A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android's features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.

- If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won't sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.
- The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.
- The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.

## Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing

As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let's explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.

### 3.1 Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.

Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here's how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.

**Step 1.** Install Pokemon Go on your Sony Xperia 5 V and create your account if you haven't already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.

**Step 2.** Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can't detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.

**Step 3.** Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Sony Xperia 5 V device again and access the new location.

### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go

If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Sony Xperia 5 V device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Sony Xperia 5 V and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your phone's Settings > System > About Phone and tap on the "Build Number" option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.

**Step 2.** Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Sony Xperia 5 V device's Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device's location.

![select Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg)

![launch Pokemon Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg)

If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won't detect its presence. Don't worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.

### 3.3 Use Fake GPS Free

This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won't access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your device's settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.

**Step 2.** Once the app is installed, go to Settings > Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.

![grant Fake GPS access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg)

**Step 3.** Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.

**Step 4.** Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.

## Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing

Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg)

**Firstly, punishment:** On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

**Thirdly, Punishment:** On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.

However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.

There are tricks that help you save from the Pokémon Go ban.

- First, you need to use a reliable tool like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone for iOS to spoof the GPS. By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.
- Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.
- You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.
- Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.

Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough. With this, you can play the game just by sitting at your home. All you need to do is install PGSharp on your device and launch it.

## Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Sony Xperia 5 V

After the incredible hype of finally getting the chance to battle other players, trainers hit a wall marked – Pokémon Go battle leagues Not Available.

It’s not the first time trainers have experienced bugs in the game and a long wait during maintenance breaks, but patience wears thin as after 2 weeks into the release of the super hyped Battle League, trainers all around the world are yet to have access to it.

The root cause of this disappointing course of events was a major bug in the first season of the Battle League. Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.

## Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?

Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.

Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.

The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.

Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.

Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.

![pokemon 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg)

Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.

Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;

- **Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –** Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.
- **Fast Attacks are slower on Android –** Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.
- **Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -** Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.
- **Go Battle wins are not counted –** Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.
- **Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –** A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.
- **Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –** The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.
- **Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –** After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.

## Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?

It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.

Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.

Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.

The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.

After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.

Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.

![pokemon 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg)

After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.

Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.

Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.
