### Use Virtual Location to catch the Pok√©mon Go creature

You can use the faux location of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pok√©mon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pok√©mon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pok√©mon any place without making any movement.

**Step 1: Install:**

Install the ‚ÄòDr. Fone toolkit‚Äô from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‚ÄòVirtual Location‚Äô tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2: Connect:**

Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‚ÄòGet Started‚Äô button to use the services of Dr. Fone.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:**

Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‚ÄòTeleport‚Äô mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‚ÄòGo‚Äô after the selection.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‚ÄòMove Here‚Äô button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‚Äò1‚Äô, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pok√©mon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pok√©mon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.

## Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pok√©mon Go?

Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pok√©mon that was initially launched in Pok√©mon Go. It is original since each and every other Pok√©mon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pok√©mon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pok√©mon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pok√©mon from Pok√©mon Go to Pok√©mon Home or associating your Pok√©mon Go account to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go‚Äô and ‚ÄòPok√©mon Home‚Äô accounts as described earlier.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pok√©mon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pok√©mon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pok√©mon without Traveling On Lava Yuva 2 Pro

The main goal that the designers of Pok√©mon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pok√©mon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pok√©mon enlisted as ‚Äòblanks‚Äô in your Pokedex and you haven‚Äôt yet found them, it‚Äôs probably because they are marked as ‚Äòregional‚Äô types. This means that these Pok√©mon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don‚Äôt Panic! You don‚Äôt have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pok√©mon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pok√©mon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pok√©mon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pok√©mon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pok√©mon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pok√©mon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pok√©mon won‚Äôt become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pok√©mon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch‚Äôd spawned during the 2017 Pok√©mon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pok√©mon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pok√©mon.

List of different Regional Pok√©mon ‚Äì Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pok√©mon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pok√©mon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let‚Äôs get into the list of all the region-specific Pok√©mon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pok√©mon

Catching regionally exclusive Pok√©mon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pok√©mon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pok√©mon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you‚Äôre traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pok√©mon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you‚Äôre actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pok√©mon

Catching regional Pok√©mon is just like catching any regular Pok√©mon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pok√©mon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pok√©mon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pok√©mon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pok√©mon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pok√©mon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pok√©mon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pok√©mon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pok√©mon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pok√©mon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pok√©mon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pok√©mon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pok√©mon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pok√©mon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.



## Will Pok√©mon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Lava Yuva 2 Pro

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pok√©mon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pok√©mon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pok√©mon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pok√©mon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pok√©mon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pok√©mon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pok√©mon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pok√©mon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pok√©mon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pok√©mon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.
