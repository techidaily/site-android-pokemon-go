## Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?

The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review.

![pokemon go route missing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-4.JPG)

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

- **Pokemon Go Friend Code**

Pokemon Go Friend Code is a dedicated online directory having thousands of trainer codes. Once you visit the website, you can also submit your PoGo friend code to its directory so that other players can find it. Besides that, there is also a provision to look for other players and filter results based on their teams and location.

If you are looking for Pokemon Go friend codes, then the sky is the limit. Apart from dedicated apps and websites, you can also find Instagram pages, Twitter handles, and Quora spaces to exchange PoGo friend codes.

## Part 5: How to Add Friends in Pokemon Go?

Once you have found Pokemon Go codes for friends, you can add them to your network in the following way:

1. Firstly, just launch Pokemon Go and tap on your avatar from the bottom panel.
2. As your account settings would be opened, go to the “Friends” option from the top.
3. Here, you can view players who are already added to your account. To make new friends in Pokemon Go, tap on the “Add Friend” option.
4. Now, you can enter their unique Pokemon friend code that would send them an add request. You can also view your Pokemon Go trainer code from here and share it with others.

## Part 6: How to Find new Pokemons to Level-up in the Game?

Adding friends in Pokemon Go is not enough as you need to have some powerful Pokemon to win battles. Since going out and looking for Pokemons is not that feasible, consider using [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). Using this trusted application, you can easily spoof your iPhone location to catch tons of Pokemons.

- You can just connect your iPhone to the application and use its Teleport Mode to spoof your location.
- Users can just enter an address or the coordinates of the target location and further adjust the pin on the map.
- You can also simulate the movement of your iPhone between multiple spots at a preferred speed.
- The interface will include a GPS joystick, letting your move on the map naturally.
- Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) is extremely simple and it does not need any jailbreak access as well.

Though, to win more battles and level-up in the game, you can consider using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS). It is a 100% trusted application that would let you spoof your iPhone location so that you can catch your favorite Pokemons remotely.
