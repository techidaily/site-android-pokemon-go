## Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Lava Agni 2 5G

Pokémon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others' privacy. The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.

What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.

## Part 1: What does Soft Banned & Cooldown Mean?

A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.

What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.

## Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?

When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.

## Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?

### 1\. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?

The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.

| **Total Distance Covered** | **Cooldown Period** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 km | 30 seconds |
| 5 km | 2 minutes |
| 10 km | 6 minutes |
| 25 km | 11 minutes |
| 30 km | 14 minutes |
| 65 km | 22 minutes |
| 81 km | 25 minutes |
| 100 km | 35 minutes |
| 250 km | 45 minutes |
| 500 km | 1 hour |
| 750 km | 1 hour 20 minutes |
| 1000 km | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| \>1500 km | 2 hour |

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?

The waiting period for a soft ban is around 12 hours. After this time, if you can try and catch a Pokémon, it means the soft ban is over.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?

The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.

So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.

- If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan's Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.
- Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.
- When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.
- When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.
- Gym battles.
- When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Actions that DO NOT trigger cooldown?

On the other hand, some actions that do not trigger a cooldown in Pokémon Go;

- We are encountering a wild Pokémon.
- Feeding a berry to a gym defender remotely.
- Teleporting
- Auto Walking
- Eggs hatching
- Exchanging gifts.
- Pokémon evolution.
- Catching reward Pokémon from quests
- Speed raids but only after a 2-hour Cooldown
- Trading a Pokémon
- Transferring a Pokémon
- Buddy changing
- Using Candies and Stardust to get a second move for a Pokémon
- Incense, Lucky Egg or Starpiece
- Player vs. Player or team leader battles
- Buying a Lure Module or Special Lure at a PokéStop
- Buying coins and shop items
- Pokémon power up
- Speed raids without a 2-hour Cooldown
- Claiming rewards
- Changing your avatar's clothes or items
- Clicking on a gym with an active raid to get a free raid pass
- Finding and catching certain Pokémon from s Smeargle and Party Hat Pikachu
- Dropping a ball

### 5\. What happens if you break the cooldown of Pokémon Go?

When you break the cooldown Pokémon go, you are bound to face a soft ban. How do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? If you attempt to take any action in the game and receive a "Try Again Later" error message, it means you are soft banned.

## Part 4: The Safest Way to Teleport in Pokémon GO Without Getting Banned?

As we already discussed, teleport does not trigger soft ban or cooldown restrictions. So, it is a valid method of moving on without any risks. While location spoofers and using VPNs can be risky, and you may get banned and lose your records, we recommend using a safe application that is Dr.Fone Virtual location, to elevate your game and fun.

Dr. Fone allows you to teleport anywhere in the world along with other unique features, including route simulation, GPS control, and unlimited choices of locations. Also, the new location gets active right away in the game.

It is a very simple-to-use application and provides robust results if you follow the guidelines. You have to make sure that the following best practices are followed, including;

- Always wait for the cooldown period to be over so that the game does not flag your account because of very fast movement and change of location. We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.
- Always log off from Pokémon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen. Scroll down to locate and click the logout button.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS/Android) is an easy and reliable teleporting method for Android and iOS. So let us visit how to teleport using this software step by step.

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.

## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

## Part 1. How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon

Locating Giovani’s hideout is never a walk in the park as you need to complete some daunting tasks. A detailed explanation of each task is given below:

### 1\. A Troubling Situation Task

This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.

How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani

Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1**

This step should be completed with ease since you aren't new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.

**Reward:** 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2**

For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.

**Reward:** 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3**

After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.

**Rewards:** 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4**

For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.

**Rewards:** One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies

### 2\. Giovani Special Research Task

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

![giovani special research](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani-special-research.jpg)

After completing the quest above, Giovani Special Research or Looming in the Shadows is the next and final quest you have to complete to face Giovani. It's a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.

![a troubling situation task](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg)

On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar. Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag. This reward doesn't only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.

## Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?

Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.

The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.

Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:

| Lineup of Creature | Pokemon |
| --- | --- |
| First | Persian |
| Second | Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp |
| Third | Mewtwo |

For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.

When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.

Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn't just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.

Once you defeat Team Go Rocket's second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn't be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.

Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.

## Part 3. Tips to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go

![giovani](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani.jpg)

Just as you did against Team Go Rocket Leaders, Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra, you need a Pokemon stronger than two of Giovani’s. With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.

Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.

Getting a strong Pokemon won't come with ease, however, with the use of [Dr.Fone- Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) you can achieve this.
