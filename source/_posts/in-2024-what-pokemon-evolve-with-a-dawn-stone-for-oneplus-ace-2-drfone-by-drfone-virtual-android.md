A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade.

## Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on OnePlus Ace 2?

Pokemon Go is probably one of the most popular location-based augmented reality games that encourage us to step out. Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.

![Pokemon Go Joystick Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg)

## **Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know**

Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.

- Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.
- They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.
- The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.

![Pokemon Go Joystick](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg)

Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.

## **Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?**

There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS/Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:

- Stay Safe Indoors

    Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.

- Move Beyond your Area

    If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.

- Catch More Pokemons

    One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!

- Level-up in the Game Easily

    From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.

- Have a Better Gaming Experience

    Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.

## **Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?**

While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.

- Account Ban by Niantic

    Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.

    ![Pokemon Go Account Ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg)

    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg)

- Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices

    To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.

- The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down

    Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your iPhone to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.

- It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your iPhone.
- If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.
- The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.
- There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import/export routes as GPX files.

## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)

- Make sure that the Pokemon Go joystick you are using is a reliable solution (like the ones listed above).
- If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.

There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solutions that you can explore.
