## Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?

Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.

If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.

## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020

A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android's features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.

- If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won't sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.
- The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.
- The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.

## Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing

As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let's explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.

### 3.1 Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.

Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here's how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.

**Step 1.** Install Pokemon Go on your Tecno Pop 8 and create your account if you haven't already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.

**Step 2.** Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can't detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.

**Step 3.** Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Tecno Pop 8 device again and access the new location.

### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go

If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Tecno Pop 8 device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Tecno Pop 8 and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your phone's Settings > System > About Phone and tap on the "Build Number" option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.

### 3.3 Use Fake GPS Free

This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won't access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your device's settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.

**Step 2.** Once the app is installed, go to Settings > Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![grant Fake GPS access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg)

**Step 3.** Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.

**Step 4.** Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Tecno Pop 8

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.
