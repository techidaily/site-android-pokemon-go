## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On OnePlus 12R

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

![confirm your pokemon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/confirm-your-pokemon.jpg)

By following the steps above, you will be awarded a Mystery Box in Pokémon Go, and you can activate it by advancing to your item bag.

### Use Virtual Location to catch the Pokémon Go creature

You can use the faux location of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pokémon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.

**Step 1: Install:**

Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2: Connect:**

Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:**

Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.

## Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?

Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pokémon that was initially launched in Pokémon Go. It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.
