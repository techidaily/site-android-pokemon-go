Apart from using a **Pok√©mon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pok√©mon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù Pok√©mon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pok√©mon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pok√©mon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pok√©mon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pok√©mon Go map. Trading Pok√©mon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle.

Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you‚Äôre one of them, this guide will help. In today‚Äôs article, we are going to discuss if you can download **iSpoofer for Android**¬†or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.

So, without any further ado, let‚Äôs get started.

- [Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1)
- [Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2)

## ****Part 1: ¬†Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****

Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn‚Äôt available for Android. It‚Äôs an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won‚Äôt be able to download **iSpoofer for Android**¬†at all.

However, the good news is that you don‚Äôt need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that‚Äôll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you‚Äôll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.

## ****Part 2: ¬†Common ways to spoof on Android****

When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you‚Äôll have to be extra cautious. _Why?_ Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren‚Äôt reliable and may damage your smartphone‚Äôs overall functionality as well.

Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.

1. **Use VMOS**

VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you‚Äôll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you‚Äôll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.

![vmos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg)

The only downside of using VMOS is that it‚Äôs extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you‚Äôll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn‚Äôt have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.

2. **Root Your Device**

Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you‚Äôll root your device, you won‚Äôt be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don‚Äôt want to void your smartphone‚Äôs warranty, ‚Äòrooting‚Äô may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.

3. **Use PGSharp**

PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to **iSpoofer for Android**. It‚Äôs a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it‚Äôs compatible with all Android devices. You won‚Äôt have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.

You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.

**Note:** Keep in mind that PGSharp isn‚Äôt available on Google Play Store and you‚Äôll have to download it from the official [<u>PGSharp website</u>](https://www.pgsharp.com/).
