If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.

## Conclusion

These are all the games that are similar to Pokémon Go and something that you can try on your own time to see the different concepts of how AR is integrated into this game. Though the games require you to walk and track your GPS, it will motivate you to move a little and get out of the room. If you are not keen on doing that, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/), can also help you to virtually go to any place on the earth without having to get up from your couch. These games will surely entertain not only you but also the friends that you can play with.
