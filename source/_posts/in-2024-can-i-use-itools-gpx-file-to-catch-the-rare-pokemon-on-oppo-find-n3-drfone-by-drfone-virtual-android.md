## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)

- Make sure that the Pokemon Go joystick you are using is a reliable solution (like the ones listed above).
- If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.

There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solutions that you can explore. While there are plenty of Pokemon Go spoofer APK tools for Android devices, iOS users can try [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).

Pokemon Go is a popular game that has taken the world by storm. It is an augmented reality game that allows players to catch Pokemon in the real world using their smartphones. However, many players have reported encountering the "Failed to detect location (12)" error while playing the game. This error can be frustrating as it prevents players from playing the game properly. In this article, we will discuss what causes the "Failed to detect location (12)" error in Pokemon Go and how you can fix it on your Oppo Find N3.

Pokémon Go has been on the nerves of its players and this is all because of the AR notion that it presents. The failed to detect location 12 is one of the most common errors that are faced by the players while playing this game. You might not believe but the GPS signals and the location settings on iPhone or Android are the two main reasons for this error. It can be resolved with ease and this article has been written to get the work done with ease. Applying the methods explained will ensure that you get the best results overall.


## Part 1: Why is Location Important in Pokémon Go?

The best part of this game is that it has been compiled keeping in view the location mechanics. The location analytics of the game has made sure that it becomes the overnight sensation. Three main attributes are associated with the location framework of the game. These attributes also show how important the location is for the game. Understanding these attributes will also make sure that the user can overcome the errors such as failed to detect location 12 GPS joystick 2019.

### i. Physical World Attribute

The best part of this attribute is that it is the center of the user experience of the game. The second part is the fact that this map has evolved and there are no shortcuts to its success. Ingress was the previous game that was developed by Niantic and the crowdsourcing of this map started with the evolution of this application. This was developed by the same team that is working on the core of Google Earth.

### ii. Real World Gestures

The augmented reality is another important aspect that is related to Pokemon Go and this also means that the location services are relied on when it comes to this application. The android and the iOS location services are continuously used by the game to provide the pinpoint locations as well as the game features that are not found in other applications. The use of location through GPS satellites even becomes more important for such gestures. Especially when the player is outdoors it becomes too important to deal with using GPS location.

### iii. Place Attribution

The system within the system that has been designed by the game developers makes sure that the location inaccuracies are accounted for. This also means that the 4-meter accuracy of the GPS is further enhanced to deal with the perfect location identification of each player.
