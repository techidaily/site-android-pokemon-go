## Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Lava Yuva 2 Pro

Pokémon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others' privacy. The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.

What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.

## Part 1: What does Soft Banned & Cooldown Mean?

A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.

What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.

## Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?

When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.

## Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?

### 1\. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?

The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.

| **Total Distance Covered** | **Cooldown Period** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 km | 30 seconds |
| 5 km | 2 minutes |
| 10 km | 6 minutes |
| 25 km | 11 minutes |
| 30 km | 14 minutes |
| 65 km | 22 minutes |
| 81 km | 25 minutes |
| 100 km | 35 minutes |
| 250 km | 45 minutes |
| 500 km | 1 hour |
| 750 km | 1 hour 20 minutes |

### 2\. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?

The waiting period for a soft ban is around 12 hours. After this time, if you can try and catch a Pokémon, it means the soft ban is over.

### 3\. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?

The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.

So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.

- If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan's Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.
- Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.
- When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.
- When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.
- Gym battles.
- When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.

### 4\. Actions that DO NOT trigger cooldown?

On the other hand, some actions that do not trigger a cooldown in Pokémon Go;

- We are encountering a wild Pokémon.
- Feeding a berry to a gym defender remotely.
- Teleporting
- Auto Walking
- Eggs hatching
- Exchanging gifts.
- Pokémon evolution.
- Catching reward Pokémon from quests
- Speed raids but only after a 2-hour Cooldown
- Trading a Pokémon
- Transferring a Pokémon
- Buddy changing
- Using Candies and Stardust to get a second move for a Pokémon
- Incense, Lucky Egg or Starpiece
- Player vs. Player or team leader battles
- Buying a Lure Module or Special Lure at a PokéStop
- Buying coins and shop items
- Pokémon power up
- Speed raids without a 2-hour Cooldown
- Claiming rewards
- Changing your avatar's clothes or items
- Clicking on a gym with an active raid to get a free raid pass
- Finding and catching certain Pokémon from s Smeargle and Party Hat Pikachu
- Dropping a ball

### 5\. What happens if you break the cooldown of Pokémon Go?

When you break the cooldown Pokémon go, you are bound to face a soft ban. How do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? If you attempt to take any action in the game and receive a "Try Again Later" error message, it means you are soft banned.

## Part 4: The Safest Way to Teleport in Pokémon GO Without Getting Banned?

As we already discussed, teleport does not trigger soft ban or cooldown restrictions. So, it is a valid method of moving on without any risks. While location spoofers and using VPNs can be risky, and you may get banned and lose your records, we recommend using a safe application that is Dr.Fone Virtual location, to elevate your game and fun.

Dr. Fone allows you to teleport anywhere in the world along with other unique features, including route simulation, GPS control, and unlimited choices of locations. Also, the new location gets active right away in the game.

It is a very simple-to-use application and provides robust results if you follow the guidelines. You have to make sure that the following best practices are followed, including;

- Always wait for the cooldown period to be over so that the game does not flag your account because of very fast movement and change of location. We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.
- Always log off from Pokémon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen. Scroll down to locate and click the logout button.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS/Android) is an easy and reliable teleporting method for Android and iOS. So let us visit how to teleport using this software step by step.

## Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?

Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.

If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.

## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020

A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android's features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.

- If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won't sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.
- The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.
- The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.

### 3.1 Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.

Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here's how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.

**Step 1.** Install Pokemon Go on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro and create your account if you haven't already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.

**Step 2.** Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can't detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.

**Step 3.** Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device again and access the new location.

![vpn for android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg)

### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go

If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your phone's Settings > System > About Phone and tap on the "Build Number" option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.

![Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device's Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device's location.

![select Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg)

**Step 3.** That's it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.

If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won't detect its presence. Don't worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.

### 3.3 Use Fake GPS Free

This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won't access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your device's settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.

**Step 2.** Once the app is installed, go to Settings > Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.

**Step 3.** Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.

**Step 4.** Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.
