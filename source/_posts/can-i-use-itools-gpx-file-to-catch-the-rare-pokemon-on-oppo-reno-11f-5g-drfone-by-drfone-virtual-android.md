### Steps To Enhance Your Gaming Experience With One-Click Location Spoofer of 2024

Save time and energy by using Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location feature. There is no need to physically travel to different places by simply adjusting your virtual location.

When coupled with powerful Pokémon GO Plus +, it can increase your chances of encountering Sleeping Snorlax significantly. Here is how to enhance your gaming experience and get help in capturing **Pokémon sleeping Snorlax** via Dr.Fone - Virtual Location:

- **Step 1.** **Activate Teleport Mode in Dr.Fone - Virtual Location**

Open Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, connect your smartphone with an original USB cable, and choose the "Teleport Mode" option located in the top-right section. The specific icon for Teleport Mode is the first one from the left in that section. Once Teleport Mode is activated, click on the search bar at the top-left to input the desired location. After entering the location, press "Enter" to continue.
