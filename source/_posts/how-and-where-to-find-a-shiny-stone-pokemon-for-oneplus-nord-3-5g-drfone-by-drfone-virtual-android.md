You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

Pokemon Go Friend Code is a dedicated online directory having thousands of trainer codes. Once you visit the website, you can also submit your PoGo friend code to its directory so that other players can find it. Besides that, there is also a provision to look for other players and filter results based on their teams and location.

Adding friends in Pokemon Go is not enough as you need to have some powerful Pokemon to win battles.
