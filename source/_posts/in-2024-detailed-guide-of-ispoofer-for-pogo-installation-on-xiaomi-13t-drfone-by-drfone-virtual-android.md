## Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?

iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.

## Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation

This detailed guide for iSpoofer installation is for those who still possess the older version of the app that works in an older iOS version.

**Step 1 –** Install the setup for iSpoofer on your computer if you had got it using. This requires the latest version of iTunes, so make sure that you have it installed.

**Step 2 –** Once the setup is done, connect your phone to the computer and unlock it. You will have to select the “TRUST” option for the software to do its work. On selecting this option, iSpoofer will download a developer file that will spoof the location.

## Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon

Follow the tutorial above for ispoofer for pogo installation. A mock location has now been added to your device that makes iOS believe that you are at the entered spot.

![pokemon go ispoofer view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-view.jpg)

Following these steps, disconnect your phone and launch Pokemon Go. From here you can either use the joystick to move around or use a “.gpx” file to add a preset route for you to move around. That would look like this -

![gpx file for preset route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/gpx-file-for-preset-route.jpg)

iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -

- The application cannot work without iTunes and is very dependent on it.
- Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.
- Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.
- Configurations and settings require some technical knowledge in to troubleshoot any errors.
- The app is prone to crashing a lot. The interface sometimes cannot handle the constant change of locations.

All these issues are overcome with great detail by Dr. Fone Virtual Location (iOS) by Wondershare.

## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Xiaomi 13T?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

## Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Xiaomi 13T

After the incredible hype of finally getting the chance to battle other players, trainers hit a wall marked – Pokémon Go battle leagues Not Available.

It’s not the first time trainers have experienced bugs in the game and a long wait during maintenance breaks, but patience wears thin as after 2 weeks into the release of the super hyped Battle League, trainers all around the world are yet to have access to it.

The root cause of this disappointing course of events was a major bug in the first season of the Battle League. Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.

## Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?

Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.

Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.

The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.

Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.

Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.

![pokemon 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg)

Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.

Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;

- **Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –** Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.
- **Fast Attacks are slower on Android –** Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.
- **Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -** Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.
- **Go Battle wins are not counted –** Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.

## Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?

It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.

Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.

Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.

The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.

After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.

Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.

After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.

Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.

Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.

Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;

- At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.
- To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.
- From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.
- Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.
- In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.

## Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?

The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up. Other than that there are ways you can speed power up your Pokémon to increase CP to higher levels. The overall Pokémon’s collected, evolved or powered up, and battles fought in Battle League will win you points to level up in Pokémon Go.

Although it might seem like a long and hard journey, it doesn’t need to. You can catch and power up Pokémon faster and cover longer distances with some help from WondershareDr.Fone. With smoother and easier GPS spoofing you can cover Poke stops much quicker.

Here’s some tips you can put to easy use in Levelling Up in Pokémon Go:

### Tip #1: Use dr.fone Virtual Location

Use Wondershare [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily teleport to catch more poke stops at an adjustable speed and free-hand direction. The program is easy to use and a quicker way to grab more powerful Pokémon using lure.

There are several adjustments to the program that makes it fun to use. You can adjust the speed according km/hr so that the speed of the pointer would be determined as either walking, biking or driving in the game. This increases your chances to catch Pokémon at your desired pace.
