### Alert

While spoofing between two distant locations give the required amount of time for the cooldown timer to reach zero. If you decide to spoof too quickly, you will automatically trigger a soft ban, and you will not be able to play most parts of the game like catching Pokemon or spinning Pokestops. If this occurs consistently over multiple occasions, it will trigger Niantic’s warning and may end up getting a permanent ban. It has a 3-strike policy. 3 warnings are given before the account is permanently deleted.

The notice looks like this -

![pokemon go account ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-account-ban.jpg)

The cool-down period between two locations is based on distance and you can refer to the table below to understand the time you need to wait before logging in again.
