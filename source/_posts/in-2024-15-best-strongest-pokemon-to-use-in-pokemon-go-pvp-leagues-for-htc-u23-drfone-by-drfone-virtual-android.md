## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League

For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, **Pokémon GO PvP** comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pokémon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you'll find more legendary Pokémon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pokémon CP limitation in the Master League.

In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:

| **Battle Leagues** | **CP Limit** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pokémon GO Great League** | 1500 CP Limit |
| **Pokémon GO Ultra League** | 2500 CP Limit |
| **Pokémon GO Master League** | No CP limit |

## Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League

Start your Pokémon Go Battle by tapping the Poke Ball and Battle option. Afterward, assemble your team for this challenging game filled with Pokémon and attacks. As mentioned, you need Pokémon with 1500 CP to play, so this section has enlisted the stronger ones. Go through every detail of such Pokémon and finalize them for the coming Battle.

## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Before you put effort into catching the Pokémon IV 100 map, you should have knowledge about which Pokémon has a stat of 100 IV. Following are the ways with which you can check the IVs of Pokémon in the Pokémon Go game.

### 2.1 Check IVs within the app

You can check the true percentages of your characters’ IVs in the gaming app itself. Now, if you use the appraisal system of the app, your team leader will show the stats of each Pokémon and can give it a star rating as well.

Further, you can also click on the arrows on the left and right to see the stats of the next Pokémon.

### 2.2 Know Pokémon IV using search filters

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

If you wish to evolve your Pokémon or simulate your movement, then use the one-stop or multi-stop mode of the application.
