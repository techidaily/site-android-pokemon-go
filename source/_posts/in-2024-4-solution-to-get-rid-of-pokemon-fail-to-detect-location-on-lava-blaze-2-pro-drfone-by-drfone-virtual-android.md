In this world, you are a wizard where you can cast spells, interact with different notable characters from the movie franchise, defeat creatures, and explore the wizardly world of Harry Potter. You will also need to complete tasks to be able to level up and improve as a wizard. It is a unique game that will leave you wanting to play more.

### 1\. Ingress Prime

Ingress Prime is best suited for players who like the concept of playing Pokémon Go but for those who want a different storyline. In this game, you also explore different worlds based on the location that they track you in and you interact with different worlds. When you play, you will be asked to choose between two teams, the Resistance and the Enlightened, which will show you different options on how to play the game.

## Conclusion

These are all the games that are similar to Pokémon Go and something that you can try on your own time to see the different concepts of how AR is integrated into this game. Though the games require you to walk and track your GPS, it will motivate you to move a little and get out of the room. If you are not keen on doing that, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/), can also help you to virtually go to any place on the earth without having to get up from your couch. These games will surely entertain not only you but also the friends that you can play with.
