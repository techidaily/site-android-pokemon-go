## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Pokémon Go app has a search feature that you can use to know the exact IV of Pokémon. To do this, tap the search icon present at the top of your Pokémon menu. Now in the search bar, type the name of any Pokémon, say type “shiny”. This will show all the shiny mons with different star ratings.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

To learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), the following steps can be taken.

**_Step 1: Connect your device and launch the app_**

Firstly, just connect your iPhone to the application and launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone > Virtual Location feature.

![launch the Dr.Fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Just agree to the terms and click on the "Get Started" button to launch the interface of Virtual Location and start Pokemon Go how to hatch eggs at home.

![launch Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**_Step 2: Walk between two stops_**

As the interface would be launched, you can see five different modes in the top-right corner. Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![walk mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode. After that, click on the "Move Here" button.

![confirm marching](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

_**Tips:**  
1\. **Realistic Mode:** It enhances the realism of the simulation by fluctuating the speed during the simulation.  
2\. **Fluctuation Mode**: This feature enables you to move around within a 5-meter range after reaching your destination, instead of remaining static. This helps to make the GPS location change more realistic, making it less likely for Pokemon Go to detect the use of the virtual location._

This will just start the simulation, and you can even adjust the speed from a slider at the bottom.

![start the simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

**_Step 3: Move along multiple spots_**

Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), you can also simulate an entire route between multiple spots as well. To do this, just click on the "Multi-stop route" which is the fourth option in the top-right corner of the interface.

## Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer

This is one of the quickest ways to learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking. If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.

While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s **how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking** by using a GPS spoofer.

1. Firstly, unlock your Nokia C32 and go to its Settings > About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.

    ![unlock the Developer Options settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg)

2. Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
    ![location spoofing app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg)

3. That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.

    ![change your location to a few meters away](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg)

Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs. The regular use of an app like this might result in your account ban.

## Way 3: Fix Your Nokia C32 on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go

Apart from a location spoofing app, there are a handful of other ways to learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go. Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.

![Play Pokemon Go with a drone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg)

**Things to Remember**

- While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.
- Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.
- Enable the Find My Nokia C32 service on your Nokia C32 or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.
- Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.

## Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users

A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.

1. Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.

    ![go to your profile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg)

2. Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.
3. That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.

    ![help friends hack eggs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg)

**Pro-Tip**

If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!

## Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators

You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.

1. Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.
2. From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.

## Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard

This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn **how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking**. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.

Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.

## Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go

If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.

## Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go

If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.

## Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go

Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you're walking and hatch the eggs.

This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:

Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable > Turn on the turntable > Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.
