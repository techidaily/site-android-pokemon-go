**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

## Part 1: Do you know the Pok√©mon Emerald Master Ball?

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg" border="0"></a>

![The best ball to catch Pok√©mon ‚Äì Pok√©mon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pok√©mon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pok√©ball that is used to capture Pok√©mon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pok√©mon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pok√©balls that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù written on it, which possibly means ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù.

The Pok√©mon master ball emerald will capture all Pok√©mon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pok√©mon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pok√©ball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pok√©mon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pok√©mon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pok√©mon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pok√©ball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pok√©mon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 4: Other tips to level up on Pok√©mon go

When you need to level up on Pok√©mon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

### Mass Raids

Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.

**How do you go about this?**

- Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes
- Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.
- Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.

Do as many of these Raids as you can.

### Mass catching and Mass evolving

You can also catch as many Pok√©mon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time. This requires that you evolve many Similar Pok√©mon and they should be cheap to evolve. You can get a lot of XP in this way.

But how do you catch as many Pok√©mon as possible within a short time?

This is where teleporting tools such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)¬†comes in. This is a wonderful and powerful tool that allows you to teleport from one area to another without the game realizing that you are spoofing your location.
