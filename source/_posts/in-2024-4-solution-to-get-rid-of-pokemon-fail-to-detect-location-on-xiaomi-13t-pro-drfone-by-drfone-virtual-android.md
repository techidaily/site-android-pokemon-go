- **Step 4:** From there, decide if you wish to discover nearby Routes or create your own.

**NOTE:** The Create New Route feature is only available to selected Pokemon Go players. If Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up on your end, it’s probably because you’re not yet eligible.

## Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?

As previously mentioned, the root causes of the Pokemon Go Routes glitch vary from one trainer to another. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up because your Trainer Level is not high enough. Yes. This option is only available to players who reach the required level. However, the player’s respective rank is not always the culprit for this issue. There are other factors that might also result in the same problem. Check out the list below to understand it better.

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.

### You’re using an outdated Pokemon Go app version

![update pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-6.JPG)

Keep in mind that the Pokemon Go Routes is an additional game feature. That’s why you first need to update your existing Pokemon Go app before you can access it. The Routes is definitely not available to old versions of Pokemon Go mobile software.

### The current software version of your smartphone is not compatible with the Pokemon Go Routes feature

Android 6.0 and iOS 14 or higher are the main system requirements of the Pokemon Go application. The Pokemon Go Routes are not working, or perhaps the whole application malfunctions because your software version is too old. Don’t worry. A simple OS update might resolve this problem once and for all.

## Part 3. Tips on How to Fix Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your mobile device? Don’t sweat it. There are lots of troubleshooting methods you can try to fix this issue with just the snap of a finger. Check out the list below and find the best solution that works in your current situation.

## Part 4. [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/): The Best Alternative When Pokemon Go DeFit is Not Working

In simple terms, DeFit is a third-party application that allows trainers to play Pokemon Go without moving physically. You can walk the required distance for egg hatching or explore Routes from the comfort of your own home. However, there have been reports recently about Pokemon Go DeFit not working. Is there a substitute for this software? The short answer is absolutely yes. Wondershare Dr.Fone has a powerful Virtual Location feature that works exactly like DeFit. It can also simulate GPD movement to complete Pokemon Go Routes without going outdoors. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide for you.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Right after, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Open the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone immediately using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to establish a secure connection between the computer and your device.
- **Step 3:** Access the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** Navigate to the main dashboard afterward and then click **Virtual Location.** If it’s your first time using this feature, let Wondershare Dr.Fone download the additional resources needed.
- **Step 4:** After the successful download, the Virtual Location feature will then appear in a separate window. Head over to the menu bar at the top-right corner of your screen and then click **One-Stop Route.** The starting point for the simulation will be designated based on your current location. If you wish to change it, go back to the menu bar again and then click **Teleport Mode** to assign your preferred starting point. As for the destination, you can search for your desired location or tap anywhere around the map.

![wondershare drfone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

- **Step 5:** Calibrate the necessary settings according to your liking. Start by choosing your preferred type and number of trips. Right after, adjust the movement speed by moving the slider from left to write. Then, click **Move Here** to commence the simulation. If you wish to reset your inputs, click **Clear** instead.

![movement settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)
