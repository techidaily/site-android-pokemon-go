## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.

### Check your mobile device and internet connection very well

However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.

- Consider your safety as the primary priority. Stay alert and keep your essential belongings within your sight. You never know. People with ill intentions are just around the corners of the street. Hence, keep yourself safe from this kind of situation that may put your life in real danger.
- One way to broaden your online exposure is to go live on a regular and consistent timetable. Plan ahead the exact schedule of your Pokemon Go livestream and announce it on your official social media handles.
- Adhere to the rules and policies implemented not only by Pokemon Go but also by your chosen platform. Don’t break any of them because such actions can affect your progress as a player and streamer.
- Take constructive feedback positively. Yes. Expect that once you go live on the internet, you will receive various kinds of reactions from other people. But don’t let them get into your head as much as possible. Keep your head high and work on the improvements at your own pace.
