## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pok√©mon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pok√©mon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pok√©mon in the game. Ideally, not all Pok√©mon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pok√©mon in the game is measured by three tactics ‚Äì attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pok√©mon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pok√©mon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pok√©mon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pok√©mon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pok√©mon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pok√©mon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pok√©mon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù Pok√©mon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pok√©mon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pok√©mon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pok√©mon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pok√©mon Go map. Trading Pok√©mon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pok√©mon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

### Pok√©mon that Evolve with Dawn Stone

As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pok√©mon. To evolve your Pok√©mon using Dawn Stone in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the "Other Items" tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the "Use this item" option.

### 1\. Kirlia

Kirlia is a small humanoid Pok√©mon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia's natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

### 2\. Snorunt

Snorunt is an ice-type Pok√©mon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the "Snow Hat Pok√©mon." You can find Snorunt in seafoam caf√©, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pok√©mon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.

It is every player's wish to avoid the long hunt for a Dawn Stone into their Podex. This issue has given birth to some of the hacks and tricks to help players cross territory and find the intended evolution item or Pok√©mon. Some of these tricks include:

This program supports iOS 12 devices or earlier versions. However, there are scores of people who have complained about several crashes. Nevertheless, you can try it if you have got some penny to spare.
