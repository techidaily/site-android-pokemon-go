## Full Guide to Catch 100 IV Pokémon Using a Map On OnePlus 11 5G

**_“How do I find 100 IV Pokémon in Pokémon Go? I have heard of some techniques, but can’t find any reliable Pokémon Go 100 IV map that works!”_**

 As I read this query posted by a Pokémon Go player on Reddit, I realized that a lot of people can encounter this issue. Since getting a 100 IV Pokémon is something that every player wants, I decided to come up with this guide. In this post, I will share some smart tricks that would help you catch a 100 IV Pokémon. Besides that, I will also let you know how to make the most of a **100 IV Pokémon Go map** as well.

_**Tips:** Are you finding the 100 IV Pokémon Go map? Discover the ultimate solution with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, your key to pinpointing and capturing those coveted 100 IV Pokémon! Try it now and unlock endless possibilities!_

## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Yes, you read it right! With [Pokemon Go spoofing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), you can catch powerful characters in less time.

Now check the Pokémon by their star rating, as this is the easy way to know about the IVs of characters. Type “4\*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating. Mostly a star Pokémon are a 100 IV Pokémon map.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.
