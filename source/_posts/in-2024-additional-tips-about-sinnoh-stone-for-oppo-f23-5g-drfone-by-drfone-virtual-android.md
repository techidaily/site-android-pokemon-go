### 2\. Use VPN

You can leverage VPN to change your location and fool Pokémon to complete the research breakthrough. However, you should be cautious with the VPN provider. The good thing about VPN is that they are secure and do not require jailbreaking. The downside is that good VPNs are expensive and are restricted to server locations.

### 3\. iSpoofer

This is a desktop-based spoofing tool which can help you fake your location. It does not require jailbreaking and thus can easily spoof for Pokémon Go. The downside is that it requires Windows PC and that the premium version is expensive.
