### How to find rare Pok√©mon or complete your Pok√©dex?

There are various options you can try to find rare Pok√©mon and complete your Pokedex.

- **Increase your trainer level.** The higher your trainer level is, the higher your chances of finding a rare Pok√©mon are. So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pok√©mon.
- **Trade with other players.** If you have friends who also play Pok√©mon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pok√©mon with them. Just make sure you‚Äôre in a specific range with them.
- **Use incense and lures.** Both of these will help you attract more Pok√©mon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.
- **Play on the Community Days.** If you‚Äôre looking to catch a Shiny Pok√©mon, don‚Äôt forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!
- **Have friends in other regions.** You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pok√©mon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pok√©mon with each other.
- **Use a virtual GPS at home.** If you don‚Äôt have anyone to trade your regional Pok√©mon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pok√©mon!

Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pok√©mon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?
