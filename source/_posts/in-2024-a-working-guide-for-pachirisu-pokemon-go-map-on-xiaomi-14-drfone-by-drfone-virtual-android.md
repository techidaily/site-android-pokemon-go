## A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Xiaomi 14

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.


## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

### 1\. The Silph Road

The Silph Road is the biggest crowd-sourced Pokemon Go map that will let you know about the recently spawning of Pachirisu. Since the directory has data about tons of Pokemons, you can go to its filters and select Pachirisu to save time. This will let you know the recent spawning of the Pokemon with its exact coordinates.

**Website:** [https://thesilphroad.com/](https://thesilphroad.com/)

### 2\. Poke Map

If you are looking for an active Pachirisu Pokemon Go map, then you can head to this freely available website. You can know the active regions where the Pokemon has been found recently. Not just that, it will also let you know about other details of the game like raids, Pokestops, gyms, etc.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. PoGo Map

Earlier, PoGo Map was available as an app, but now you can only use its website to know the spawning of Pokemons. Since it is a global directory, you can easily use it as a Pachirisu map for Pokemon Go. You can zoom in to know the spawn location of Pachirisu with its coordinates or the exact address. Besides Pachirisu, it can also help you catch several other regional Pokemons as well.

### 4\. PokeHunter

PokeHunter is a well-known Pokemon GO tracker that provides exact information on PokeStops and gyms. It will inform you about the Pachirisu, ex-Raid battles, and locations of other Pokémon characters. With real-time tracking, it is accessible to all devices, such as PCs and mobile phones. Besides, this map can show the energy level of Pokemon and let you decide which to catch.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Teleport to any other location**

After when your device is detected, Dr.Fone will automatically display its exact location on the screen. You can now go to the Teleport Mode from the top-right to spoof your location.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, go to the search bar and just enter the address of the target location or its coordinates that you can get from a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map.

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299" border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

![ispoofer not working](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg)

## Part 2: The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Change your iPhone Location

- Since it is a 100% secure way to spoof your iPhone location, your Pokemon Go account won’t be compromised in the process.
- You can spoof your device location to anywhere you want by entering the place’s address or coordinates using the application.
- There is also a provision to simulate the Xiaomi 14 device's movement between multiple spots at any speed of your choice.
- The interface will also display a GPS joystick that you can use to move realistically on the map.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your iPhone location easily.

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone to the system**

To begin with, you can connect your iPhone to the system and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location on it. Now, agree to its terms and click on the “Get Started” button.

**Step 2: Enter the target location**

Once your iPhone is detected, the interface will display its present location. You can now click on the teleport mode icon from the top.

Now, please enter the address or the coordinates of the target location and load it on the map.

**Step 3: Spoof your iPhone location**

As you would select the target location, the application will automatically change the interface. You can now drag the pin around and even zoom in/out the map to select the target location. Lastly, you can select the “Move Here” button and the location of your iPhone would be changed automatically.

You can now launch Pokemon Go or any other GPS-based app to check the spoofed location of your iPhone.

**Note:** Keep in mind the cooldown duration before changing your location to ensure your account won’t get banned by Niantic while using the location spoofer. For instance, wait for a few minutes and only change your location realistically.

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Xiaomi 14 Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Xiaomi 14 device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Xiaomi 14 device’s location.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your iPhone location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your iPhone anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.
