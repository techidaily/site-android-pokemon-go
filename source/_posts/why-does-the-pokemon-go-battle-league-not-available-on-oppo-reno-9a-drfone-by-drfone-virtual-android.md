## Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Oppo Reno 9A

After the incredible hype of finally getting the chance to battle other players, trainers hit a wall marked ‚Äì Pok√©mon Go battle leagues Not Available.

It‚Äôs not the first time trainers have experienced bugs in the game and a long wait during maintenance breaks, but patience wears thin as after 2 weeks into the release of the super hyped Battle League, trainers all around the world are yet to have access to it.

The root cause of this disappointing course of events was a major bug in the first season of the Battle League. Some players could simply use ‚Äúcharged moves‚Äù repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.

## Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?

Pok√©mon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer‚Äôs experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.

Season 1 of the Battle League‚Äôs had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pok√©mon to charge attack, varies) the trainer‚Äôs Pok√©mon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.

The bug in the series implied that a Pok√©mon ‚Äì ‚ÄúMelmetal‚Äù is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a ‚ÄúCharged‚Äù move, essentially making the trainer using the Pok√©mon invincible during a real battle.

Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.

Players when entering the Battle League are shown ‚Äì Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.

![pokemon 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg)

Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.

Here‚Äôs a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;

- **Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks ‚Äì** Your fast attacks don‚Äôt land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.
- **Fast Attacks are slower on Android ‚Äì** Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.
- **Charged Attack Button doesn‚Äôt work when tapped -** Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.
- **Go Battle wins are not counted ‚Äì** Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.
- **Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball ‚Äì** A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.
- **Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button ‚Äì** The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pok√©mon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.
- **Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen ‚Äì** After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‚ÄòNext Battle‚Äô option disappears from the Post-win screen.

## Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?

It‚Äôs not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pok√©mon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.

Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues ‚Äì Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.

Pok√©mon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.

The first season of Pok√©mon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. ‚Äì bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.

After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.

Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![pokemon 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg)

After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with ‚Äì ‚ÄúPokemon Go Battle League Not Available‚Äù by the game.

Although this doesn‚Äôt mean that trainers wouldn‚Äôt be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.

Even so, Pok√©mon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.

Here‚Äôs a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;

- At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pok√©mon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pok√©mon encountered in 5star raids.
- To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.
- From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.
- Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.
- In Season 5 few Pok√©mon‚Äôs will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.
