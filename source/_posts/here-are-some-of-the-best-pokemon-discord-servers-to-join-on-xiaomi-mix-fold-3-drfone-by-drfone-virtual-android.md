## Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?

The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.

![Pokemon go hacks 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg)

Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.

## Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?

This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:

- Stardust
- As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.
- 1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.

No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:

- Great League Veteran
- Ultra League Veteran
- Master League Veteran.

The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.

## Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?

In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.

## Part 3. Explained: Pokemon PvP Ranking in Go Battle League

The lowest Pokemon PvP ranking in the Go Battle League is Rank 1. The ranks go higher as the player accomplishes more battles going forward. However, you have to win each of them if you wish to increase your Battle Ratings quickly. It is important to keep tabs on your ratings because it’s among the crucial components of Pokemon PvP ranking.

![legend gbl rank](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/pokemon-go-pvp-rank-6.JPG)

Go Battle League features a total of 24 ranks starting from Rank 1. The last four high ranks are called Ace, Veteran, Expert, and Legend. With regard to the reward, the set of items that winners will receive varies from one rank to another. More prizes are at stake as you climb the ladder. Thus, work your way up until you become a legend in the Pokemon Go PvP rank battles. You can surely do it. Just trust yourself enough and implement an efficient game plan. By any means possible, it will certainly work magic.

For your information, the Pokemon PvP ranking in the Go Battle League refreshes every season. That means the participants will all go back to Rank 1 once the new season approaches and sets in. Don’t worry. It’s not a big deal. If you’re able to make it last season, you can absolutely do it again one more time. Just stick to your original strategy and be patient at every turn. That’s how you do it.
