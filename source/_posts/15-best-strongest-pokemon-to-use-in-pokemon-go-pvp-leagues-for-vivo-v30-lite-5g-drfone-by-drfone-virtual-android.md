## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pok√©mon GO PvP League

For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, **Pok√©mon GO PvP** comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pok√©mon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you'll find more legendary Pok√©mon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pok√©mon CP limitation in the Master League.

In addition, these three Pok√©mon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pok√©mon with no CP limit but excludes Pok√©mon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pok√©mon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:

| **Battle Leagues** | **CP Limit** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pok√©mon GO Great League** | 1500 CP Limit |

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pok√©mon without Traveling On Vivo V30 Lite 5G

The main goal that the designers of Pok√©mon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pok√©mon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pok√©mon enlisted as ‚Äòblanks‚Äô in your Pokedex and you haven‚Äôt yet found them, it‚Äôs probably because they are marked as ‚Äòregional‚Äô types. This means that these Pok√©mon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don‚Äôt Panic! You don‚Äôt have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pok√©mon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pok√©mon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pok√©mon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pok√©mon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pok√©mon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pok√©mon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pok√©mon won‚Äôt become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pok√©mon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch‚Äôd spawned during the 2017 Pok√©mon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pok√©mon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pok√©mon.

List of different Regional Pok√©mon ‚Äì Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pok√©mon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pok√©mon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let‚Äôs get into the list of all the region-specific Pok√©mon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pok√©mon

Catching regionally exclusive Pok√©mon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pok√©mon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pok√©mon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you‚Äôre traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pok√©mon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you‚Äôre actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pok√©mon

Catching regional Pok√©mon is just like catching any regular Pok√©mon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pok√©mon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pok√©mon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pok√©mon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pok√©mon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pok√©mon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pok√©mon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pok√©mon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pok√©mon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pok√©mon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pok√©mon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pok√©mon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pok√©mon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pok√©mon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.

## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It‚Äôs a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn‚Äôt possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pok√©mon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pok√©mon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pok√©mon Go events or connecting with local Pok√©mon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don‚Äôt live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone ‚Äì Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location‚Äôs address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone ‚Äì Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button.

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.
