## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Lava Blaze Curve 5G

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Lava Blaze Curve 5G

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

Download Dr.Fone – Virtual Location. Install and launch the program. Click ‘Virtual Location’ to get access to the options window.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3: Check the Location**

**Step 4: Activate teleport mode**

Now, click on the icon given in the upper right-hand corner. Enter your desired location on the upper right field and then click ‘Go’.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Once the location has been changed, you can center your GPS or move the location on your device, it will still be set to the location you have selected.



## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.

In this article, we will discuss how Pokemon Go Routes basically work. We will also talk about the main reasons why **Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up** sometimes. Lastly, we will provide some helpful tips to fix this kind of problem. Continue reading below to learn more.

## Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?

The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review. Your Route will immediately appear on the Pokemon Go map once it receives approval from the game developer. Of course, the quality and safety of the Route must be checked thoroughly before it becomes available to the public. Another thing about the Route is that you can use it to discover and explore new walking paths near you. All you need to do is pick your preferred Route and finish the entire trail. Afterward, you can obtain special rewards and extra bonus points upon its completion.

Do you want to try Pokemon Go Routes now? Here’s a quick guide for you on how to access it on your mobile device.

- **Step 1:** Launch the Pokemon Go application on your smartphone.
- **Step 2:** On the map view, find and click the **Nearby** icon at the bottom-right corner of your screen.

![nearby option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-1.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Then, click **Route.**

![pokemon go route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-2.jpg)

- **Step 4:** From there, decide if you wish to discover nearby Routes or create your own.

**NOTE:** The Create New Route feature is only available to selected Pokemon Go players. If Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up on your end, it’s probably because you’re not yet eligible.

## Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?

As previously mentioned, the root causes of the Pokemon Go Routes glitch vary from one trainer to another. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up because your Trainer Level is not high enough. Yes. This option is only available to players who reach the required level. However, the player’s respective rank is not always the culprit for this issue. There are other factors that might also result in the same problem. Check out the list below to understand it better.

![pokemon go route missing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-4.JPG)

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.

### You’re using an outdated Pokemon Go app version

![update pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-6.JPG)

Keep in mind that the Pokemon Go Routes is an additional game feature. That’s why you first need to update your existing Pokemon Go app before you can access it. The Routes is definitely not available to old versions of Pokemon Go mobile software.

### The current software version of your smartphone is not compatible with the Pokemon Go Routes feature

Android 6.0 and iOS 14 or higher are the main system requirements of the Pokemon Go application. The Pokemon Go Routes are not working, or perhaps the whole application malfunctions because your software version is too old. Don’t worry. A simple OS update might resolve this problem once and for all.

## Part 3. Tips on How to Fix Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your mobile device? Don’t sweat it. There are lots of troubleshooting methods you can try to fix this issue with just the snap of a finger. Check out the list below and find the best solution that works in your current situation.

- Switch to another internet connection that is much stronger and more reliable. You cannot enjoy much of the Pokemon Go Routes features if you’re connected to faulty internet access. If Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up, it probably has something to do with your internet connectivity.
- Don’t hesitate to update your Pokemon Go application regularly. It’s one great way to maintain the functionality of the Routes and other Pokemon Go features.
- Grant the Pokemon Go app all the necessary permission on your smartphone. Make sure it has adequate access to location services and other required mobile functions.
- Try to use a newer mobile device when playing Pokemon Go. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Route is not working because your old smartphone is not compatible with the feature.
