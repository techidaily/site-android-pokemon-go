## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On OnePlus 12

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red.

![Enter details of the cheat code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/my-boy-pokemon-fire-red-cheat-codes-5.jpg)

**Step 4 –** Enter the Pokéstop and deactivate the cheat code.

**Step 5 –** Go to your computer and type in “PC > Item Storage”.

**Step 6 –** Withdraw a SINGLE Rare Candy

**Step 7 –** check if you have double Rare Candy entries in your storage. If they are not duplicated, then the cheat has worked as it should. If they are duplicated, then you have to close the game and redo all the steps above.

**Step 8 –** Now exit and then go back to your Item Storage, where you can withdraw as many Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candies as you would want. Simply pick a number between 001 and 999, but never use the down arrow.

## In conclusion

Getting Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red is a difficult task. These cadies are not easy to find and they may not be in a location that you can access easily. The article shows you the locations at which you can collect Pokemon Go Fire Red Candy using the normal gameplay.
