If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.
