## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 3: How to Fake GPS in Pokemon Go: 3 Foolproof Solutions

Out of all the Pokemon Go joystick and location spoofing solutions, I would recommend trying the following tools.

### 3.1 Pokemon Go Joystick for iOS (No Jailbreak Needed)

If you are looking for a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS solution, then just give [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) a try. Without the need for jailbreaking your device, you can spoof your iPhone’s location to anywhere you like. The application can also be used to simulate its movement between multiple spots at a preferred speed.

Besides that, you can also mark any location as favorite or even import/export GPX files using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location. Since the application is extremely easy to use, you don’t have to go through any technical hassle to implement this Pokemon Go joystick iOS solution.

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the application**

Firstly, you can just connect your iOS device to the computer and launch Dr.Fone – Virtual Location application. You can agree to its terms of services and click on the “Get Started” button now.

![virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Spoof your iPhone Location to Anywhere you want**

Once your iPhone is connected, its present location would automatically be displayed on the screen. To spoof the Pokemon Go location on iOS, select the “Teleport Mode” option and enter the target location’s address/name/coordinates on the search bar.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Afterward, you can select the target location and the interface would automatically load it. You can now move the pin around and even zoom in/out the map to get the desired spot. Lastly, click on the “Move Here” button to spoof the fake GPS on Pokemon Go.

**Step 3: Simulate the iPhone Movement with a joystick**

To use the Pokemon Go joystick iOS solution, you can select the One-stop or Multi-stop mode from the top. Now, you can drop the pins on the map as per your requirements to set up a route to cover.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)

- If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.

There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solutions that you can explore. While there are plenty of Pokemon Go spoofer APK tools for Android devices, iOS users can try [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).
