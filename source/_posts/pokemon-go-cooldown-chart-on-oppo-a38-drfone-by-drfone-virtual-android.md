## Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Oppo A38

Pokémon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others' privacy. The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.

What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.

## Part 1: What does Soft Banned & Cooldown Mean?

A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.

What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.

## Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?

When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.

As we already discussed, teleport does not trigger soft ban or cooldown restrictions. So, it is a valid method of moving on without any risks. While location spoofers and using VPNs can be risky, and you may get banned and lose your records, we recommend using a safe application that is Dr.Fone Virtual location, to elevate your game and fun.

Dr. Fone allows you to teleport anywhere in the world along with other unique features, including route simulation, GPS control, and unlimited choices of locations. Also, the new location gets active right away in the game.

It is a very simple-to-use application and provides robust results if you follow the guidelines. You have to make sure that the following best practices are followed, including;

- Always wait for the cooldown period to be over so that the game does not flag your account because of very fast movement and change of location. We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.
- Always log off from Pokémon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen. Scroll down to locate and click the logout button.

**Step 11:** Once the pairing is done, you can now transfer the Pokemon from the Pokemon Go smoothly. Let’s get to know that too.

After the pairing is complete, you are now ready to send your Pokemon to the Go complex Park in Pokemon Let’s Go. This can be done by following the process:

**Step 1:** Open the Pokemon Let’s Go app.

**Step 2:** In Fuschia City, talk to the Go Park Complex Attendant and select the “Bring Pokemon” option.

**Step 4:** In the map view, tap on the button “Main menu”.

**Step 5:** Then, tap the “Pokemon” Button.

**Step 6:** At the top-right section of your screen, you will find the “Nintendo Switch”, tap on that.

**Step 7:** Now select the Pokemon you want to transfer. Please note that you can only send the Pokemon you have originally discovered in the Kanto Region.

**Step 8:** Now, click on the “Send to Nintendo Switch”, when you have finally decided which Pokemon you want to send.

## Part 3: Tips to get more meltan boxes

There is a lot of confusion among the Pokemon trainers regarding how to get meltan in pokemon go. Here, we share a few tips for doing the same and reducing your confusion to zero.

### Tip No.1: Transfer Pokemon to Win a Mystery Box

With the help of pairing and connecting your Pokemon Go to the Nintendo Switch, you can actually get the opportunity to transfer the Pokemon and win a mystery box for yourself.

### Tip No.2: Transfer Pokemon to Friend’s Switch

If you cannot establish a pair with your Nintendo Switch, you can always look for your friends. In case you don’t have a Nintendo Switch with a copy of Let’s Go Pikachu, do not worry. You can still obtain a shiny meltan pokemon go mystery box. You can send Pokemon to your friend’s Nintendo switch and bang… you get the chance to catch the mythical pokemon.

### Tip No.3: Use Dr. Fone Virtual Location Service

You can catch not just one but several Meltans through the mystery box. All you need to do is move around in your area and discover the meltan available near you. But not every time, you can get this lucky to obtain the opportunity to maximize your mystery box. If this is what you are thinking, then we are happy to say that you are wrong!

With the help of [Dr.Fone- Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) service that is developed and designed for iOS devices, you can change your GPS location with just one click.

With this service provider's help, you can change your location and enjoy the unlimited fun that you had always desired.
