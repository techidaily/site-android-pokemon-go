_**Tips:** Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location! Capture as many Pokémon as possible within a short time, no matter where they appear. Explore different locations virtually and become a Pokémon-catching master! Try it now!_

## Part 1: Do you know the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball?

![The best ball to catch Pokémon – Pokémon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pokéball that is used to capture Pokémon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.

The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.

The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.

**958D8046  
A7151D70  
8BB602F7  
8CEB681A.**

All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.

If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.

You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.

When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:  
**82005274 0001**

You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.

## Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?

There are ways in which you can get unlimited Pokémon Master Balls using the Pokémon emerald Master Ball cheat codes available today.

**Step 1 -** Save your game

When you are using Pokémon game emulators such as the GameShark, you can take a snapshot of the game and save it. This enables you to quickly come back to this point should anything go wrong when trying to use the cheat codes.

![Save the game state](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-1.jpg)

**Step 2 –** Now hit the "Cheats" menu and then choose the "Cheat List". You will be presented with a new window where you can now enter the cheat codes.

![Entering the GameShark Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-3.jpg)

**Step 4 -** Now proceed and enter the master ball code. The small cod will have to be enabled before you can switch on the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball GameShark cheat code. To do this, Go to the description and then enter the master code. Now you need to paste in the following into the “Code Field”.  
**D8BAE4D9 4864DCE5**

**Step 5 –** Now proceed and enter all the codes for the Master Balls. All you have to do is enter any sort of gibberish that you want into the description and then enter the code shown above. You will now be able to get an unlimited number of Pokémon Emerald Master balls which you can use to capture as many Pokémon characters as you wish.

**Step 6 –** Proceed and enter a PokeMart and then buy Pokeballs. When you have entered the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball code, you are allowed to buy as many of these as you can fit in your bag. All you have to do is go up to the register and then buy a Pokéball, and you will get a Master Ball instead, without having to pay a dime.

![Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg)

Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want. If you are already inside the PokeMart when you enter the code, you may have to walk out and walk back in again for it to work.

![Buy as many Pokémon Emerald Master Balls as you would like using the cheat code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-5.jpg)

When you have shopped for Pokémon Emerald Master Balls to your fill, you need to disable the code so your store can go back to normal. All you have to do is go back to the “Cheat List” window and then uncheck the two little lines of Pokémon Emerald Master ball cheat codes.

Make sure that you exit the store and go back again to finish the process properly.

![Disable the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat code when you are finished shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-6.jpg)

The best thing about this method is that you do not need to enter another master ball cheat code in the future. All you have to do is go back to your Cheat List and check the box for the code once more.

## Part 4: Other tips to level up on Pokémon go

When you need to level up on Pokémon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.

## Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?

Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common.

Pokemon Go is probably one of the most popular location-based augmented reality games that encourage us to step out. Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.

Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack.

- Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.
- They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.

## **Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?**

There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS/Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:

- Stay Safe Indoors

    Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.

- Move Beyond your Area

    If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.

- Catch More Pokemons

    One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!

- Level-up in the Game Easily

    From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.

- Have a Better Gaming Experience

    Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.

## **Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?**

While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.

- Account Ban by Niantic

    Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.

    ![Pokemon Go Account Ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg)

    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg)

- Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices

    To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.

- The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down

    Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.

As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your iPhone to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.

- Users can instantly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like by entering the exact coordinates or its address.
- It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your iPhone.
- If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.
- The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.
- There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import/export routes as GPX files.
