## Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon

Follow the tutorial above for ispoofer for pogo installation. A mock location has now been added to your device that makes iOS believe that you are at the entered spot.

![pokemon go ispoofer view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-view.jpg)

Following these steps, disconnect your phone and launch Pokemon Go. From here you can either use the joystick to move around or use a “.gpx” file to add a preset route for you to move around. That would look like this -

![gpx file for preset route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/gpx-file-for-preset-route.jpg)

iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -

- The application cannot work without iTunes and is very dependent on it.
- Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.
- Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.
- Configurations and settings require some technical knowledge in to troubleshoot any errors.
- The app is prone to crashing a lot. The interface sometimes cannot handle the constant change of locations.

All these issues are overcome with great detail by Dr. Fone Virtual Location (iOS) by Wondershare.

## Part 4: Safer tool to spoof pokemon- drfone virtual location

Pokemon Go Spoofers using iOS need not depend on iSpoofer for jumping locations. [Dr. Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare is the new, safer app to spoof in Pokemon Go. The app uses mock location services to help you teleport to anywhere across the world. This also allows you to be safe from the detection software in Pokemon Go.

### What are the benefits of using Dr. Fone Virtual Location?

- **It provides a mock location and location changer –** With just a single click, the application can change your location to where you want to. All apps on your phone will start recognizing this location.
- **It enables you to move at different speeds -** It has 3 different speeds, namely walking, cycling, and driving that helps you travel faster or log in kilometers too.
- **The joystick allows movement –** You can use the joystick to move your character around the map to navigate to Pokestops or rare wild spawns easily.
- **The map view gives a 360o view –** By scrolling around the screen, you can get to see all the routes around you and plan accordingly.
- **Auto-walk feature -** The game has an auto-walk feature in case you do not want to use the joystick to move around manually.
- **Keyboard movement commands –** The player can also use the A, S, W and D keys on the keyboard to move around

The teleportation is now complete. Enjoy playing the game with no lags or errors.

### Alert

While spoofing between two distant locations give the required amount of time for the cooldown timer to reach zero. If you decide to spoof too quickly, you will automatically trigger a soft ban, and you will not be able to play most parts of the game like catching Pokemon or spinning Pokestops. If this occurs consistently over multiple occasions, it will trigger Niantic’s warning and may end up getting a permanent ban. It has a 3-strike policy. 3 warnings are given before the account is permanently deleted.

The notice looks like this -

![pokemon go account ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-account-ban.jpg)

![cooldown time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cooldown-time.jpg)
