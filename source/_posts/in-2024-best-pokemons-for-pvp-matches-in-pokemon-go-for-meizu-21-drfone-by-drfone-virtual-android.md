## Part 4. Win Pokemon Go PvP Rank Battles With [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

It’s fair to say that winning Pokemon Go PvP rank battles relies heavily on how well you prepare. That’s why you should catch as many strong Pokemon as possible beforehand. Sure. Catching Pokemon in the wild is not as easy as falling off a log. You have to travel a distance and wander aimlessly until you come across your target. But did you know that there’s actually a tool that can help you do all this stuff without going outdoors? Yes. Wondershare Dr.Fone has a potent Virtual Location feature capable of modifying your current whereabouts and simulating GPS movements. Do you want to try it out? Here’s a short guide to get you started.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website. </u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Right after, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Open the newly installed application on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to ensure the connection between the two devices is strong and reliable.
- **Step 3:** Head over to the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** On the main dashboard, click **Virtual Location.** Let Wondershare Dr.Fone download additional resources if it’s your first time accessing this feature.
- **Step 4:** Once the downloading process has been completed, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will subsequently open in a separate window. From there, access the top-right menu bar and then click **One-Stop Route.** The starting point for the simulation will be determined according to your current location. If you wish to change it, click **Teleport Mode** on the menu bar and then assign your preferred location. As for the destination, enter your desired location into the search bar or tap anywhere on the map.

After that, it’s time to commence the simulation. Click **Move Here** to proceed. If you wish to reset your inputs, click **Clear** instead.
