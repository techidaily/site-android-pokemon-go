Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it‚Äôs not enough. Evolving your Pok√©mon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.

Now, while some of your Pok√©mon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pok√©mon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive ‚Äì one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.

**Pok√©mon Go Sun Stone evolutions** can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.

## Part 1. What Are Sun Stones in Pok√©mon Go?

The Sun Stone is one of eight evolution items you‚Äôll need in Pok√©mon Go. Glowing bright red and orange, it is effortless to recognize in the game, immediately catching your eye even in the busiest of environments. Consider yourself lucky if you come across one casually.

## Part 2. Pok√©mon Go Sun Stone Evolutions Explained

![five of the evolution items in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-3.jpg)

Evolutions in Pok√©mon Go aren‚Äôt always the same. You‚Äôll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pok√©mon. Depending on the species, you‚Äôll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don‚Äôt worry, evolutions don‚Äôt affect the total number of Pok√©mon in your collection).

Depending on the specific Pok√©mon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pok√©mon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pok√©mon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pok√©mon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pok√©mon).

You can always check out how to evolve your Pok√©mon in your Pok√©dex.

## Part 3. Which Pok√©mon Evolve With Sun Stones?

![sunken and sunflora in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-4.jpg)

Every Pok√©mon you come across in the game is different, and they‚Äôll all have varying evolution requirements. Considering how elusive the Sun Stone can be, it‚Äôs great that only a few Pok√©mon require it. Check out the following Pok√©mon Sun Stone evolution list.

### Pok√©mon Sun Stone Evolution List

| **Pok√©mon** | **Items Needed** | **Sun Stone Evolutions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gloom | Sun Stone and 100 Oddish candy | Bellossom |
| Sunkern | Sun Stone and 50 Sunkern candy | Sunflora |
| Cottonee | Sun Stone and 50 Cottonee candy | Whimsicott |
| Petilil | Sun Stone and 50 Petilil candy | Lilligant |
| Helioptile | Sun Stone and 50 Helioptilecandy | Heliolisk |

## Part 4. How to Acquire Sun Stones on Pok√©mon Go

![sun stone and helioptile in pok√©mon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-5.jpg)

While certainly not the rarest evolution item in Pok√©mon Go, that title belonging to the ever-elusive Axew's Unova Stone, the Sun Stone will still make you work for it. Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.

Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pok√©mon evolutions in a few different ways.

### Special Events

Partaking in Pok√©mon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pok√©mon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pok√©mon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:

- Lunar New Year ‚Äì February 5 to February 11;
- Carnival of Love ‚Äì February 13 to February 15;
- Road to Sinnoh ‚Äì February 19 to February 23.

You‚Äôll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll get a Sun Stone, there‚Äôs always a possibility!

### Field Research

Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pok√©mon, so he‚Äôll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you‚Äôll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.

Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a Pok√©Stop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same Pok√©Stop on the same day.

As you‚Äôre completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pok√©mon.

### Special Research

With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit Pok√©Stops when you‚Äôre up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they‚Äôre too difficult for you. With special research, you don‚Äôt have all that much flexibility.

Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can‚Äôt disregard or discard them.

As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you‚Äôll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.

### Gyms and PokeStops

Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and Pok√©Stops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day Pok√©Stop streak, as that will guarantee you‚Äôll get an evolution item.

While you‚Äôll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.

Usually, it‚Äôs in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more Pok√©Stops, as you‚Äôll be able to make more spins faster.

## Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently

![Text‚Äù sun stone in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg)

Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and Pok√©Stops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pok√©mon Go. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.

### Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly

Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.

To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you‚Äôll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pok√©mon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There‚Äôs virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.

Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you‚Äôre out and about while you‚Äôre actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.

You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you‚Äôre moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you‚Äôre using a location spoofer.

To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:



1. Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;
2. Connect your phone to your computer;
3. Go to **Toolbox > Virtual Location > Get Started**;

### Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events

Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you‚Äôll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pok√©mon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you‚Äôll always want to know precisely when they start and end.

Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pok√©mon Go on social media or visit the official Pok√©mon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.

## Conclusion

Acquiring Sun Stones for Pok√©mon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone ‚Äì especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.

## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Oppo A78 5G?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don‚Äôt know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer‚Äôs return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‚ÄòMaintenance‚Äô pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven‚Äôt heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won‚Äôt be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren‚Äôt many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won‚Äôt suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don‚Äôt know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don‚Äôt play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‚Äòchanging‚Äô your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won‚Äôt pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share‚Äôs Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‚Äòvigilante‚Äô does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.

For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.

But, spoofing Pok√©mon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

**Thirdly, Punishment:** On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.
