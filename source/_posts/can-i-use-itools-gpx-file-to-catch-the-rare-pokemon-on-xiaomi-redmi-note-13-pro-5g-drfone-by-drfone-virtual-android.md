## Part 3. Best Ways to Get Stardust in Pokemon Go

Since having Stardust is crucial for your Pokemon Go experience, you may be looking for the best ways to accumulate as many consumables as possible. We’ll present a couple of ways to reach your goals below.

### Through Pvp Rewards

One of the best ways to earn Stardust is through Player versus Player features. When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.

For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.

Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.

### By Opening Gifts

Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.

The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.

### By Hatching Pokemon

Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.

You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:

- 400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;
- 600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;
- 800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;
- 1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;
- 3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.

You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.

![eggs in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg)

### By Catching Pokemon

Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.

Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.

If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.

![catch a pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg)

### By Claiming Raid Rewards

When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.

Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.

If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!

### By Getting Rocket Rewards

Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket. Each time you beat this criminal group, you’ll be rewarded with either 500 or 1,000 Stardust points, depending on whether you were fighting Grunt or Team Go Leader.

Additionally, if you ever face Giovanni, you’ll get 5,000 points for fighting and beating him.

### By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks

Each player will get their daily to-do list depending on their skill and game level. Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.

The amount of points you will win depends on the task's difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.

For instance, if you’re on level 45, you can head to the Go Battle League 45 times to earn 4,500 Stardust points.

![pokemon go research tasks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-9.jpg)

### By Visiting the Gym

While on your daily walk in the Pokemon world, you should check out whether you can find some Gyms around you. If you do, stop by to hang around with some of the most precious Pokemon characters and give them a berry while you’re there.

You’ll earn 20 Stardust points for each berry you give a Pokemon. It may be the easiest way to earn and use these points for your experience. Plus, you’ll meet new characters and fully experience what the Pokemon world offers.

### Tip 1: Start from the low leagues

As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:

- **Great League:** Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)
- **Ultra League:** Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)
- **Master League:** No CP limit

![leagues in pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.

### Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves

Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.

- **Fast attacks:** These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.
- **Charge attack:** Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.
- **Shield:** This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.
- **Swapping:** Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.

![moves in pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons

This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.

### Tip 4: Know the current Meta

In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.

There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.

### Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy

This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.

Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.

![shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves

To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.

During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.

### Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap

This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.

In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.

## Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?

Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.

- The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.
- Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.
- Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.
- The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.
- The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.

## Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?

During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.

- **Team composition**

Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.

- **Focus on attacks**

Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.

- **Consider Pokemon Stats**

Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.

![meta pokemons in pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg)

Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.

- **Lead**

Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.

- **Attacker**

If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.

- **Defender**

While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.

- **Closer**

In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.

![skarmory in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg)

## Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles

Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.

- **Turns**

Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.

- **Energy**

You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.

- **Switching**

Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.
